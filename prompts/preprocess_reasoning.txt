You will be given a paragraph to rephrase. Your task is to rewrite the paragraph using shorter sentences, where each sentence captures a single idea. The content and meaning of the original paragraph should be preserved in your rephrased version.

Here is the paragraph you need to rephrase:

<original_paragraph>
{PARAGRAPH}
</original_paragraph>

Follow these steps to complete the task:

1. Read the paragraph carefully to understand its main ideas and content.
2. Break down the information into individual concepts or points.
3. Rewrite each concept as a separate, concise sentence.
4. Ensure that each sentence conveys only one main idea.
5. Maintain the logical flow and connection between sentences.
6. Double-check that all information from the original paragraph is included in your rephrased version.
7. Verify that the overall meaning and intent of the original paragraph are preserved.

Remember:
- Keep sentences short and to the point.
- Use clear and simple language.
- Avoid complex sentence structures or multiple clauses.
- Do not add any new information that wasn't in the original paragraph.
- Do not omit any important details from the original paragraph.

Present your rephrased paragraph in the following format:

<result>
[Insert your rephrased paragraph here]
</result>

Before submitting your final answer, review your rephrased paragraph to ensure it accurately represents the content of the original while using shorter, more focused sentences.
