0775e10d-8145-4cc3-b013-aab590dd7228,We should ban genetically modified crops,gpt-4.1,"Honorable judges, respected opponents, and esteemed audience members,

Today, we stand before you to affirm a position of critical importance: We should ban genetically modified crops.

Let us begin with what lies at the heart of this debate: the safety and preservation of our health, our environment, and our agricultural sovereignty. While the promises of biotechnology are tempting—higher yields, purported reduction in pesticide use, and increased food security—we must not let convenience overshadow caution. The risks and uncertainties associated with genetically modified (GM) crops are vast and grave enough to justify a comprehensive ban.

First and foremost, the safety of GM crops for human consumption remains uncertain. The process of genetic modification involves inserting genes from unrelated organisms, sometimes even from different kingdoms, into crops. This can unpredictably affect the plant’s biochemistry. Numerous scientific studies have indicated potential allergenicity, toxicological effects, and unpredictable genetic interactions. Even though regulatory agencies often attempt to assess safety, their testing methods are far from exhaustive. Many studies are short-term and do not capture the cumulative or long-term effects of consuming GM foods. The case of StarLink corn, which was approved for animal feed but found its way into human food, triggering recalls and consumer panic, is a stark reminder of the potential for unintended consequences.

Second, GM crops pose undeniable environmental risks. The introduction of herbicide-tolerant and pest-resistant GM plants has accelerated the evolution of “superweeds” and “superpests” that require even more toxic chemicals to control. Farmers are caught in a treadmill, needing to use higher doses and more potent poisons, undermining the very promise that GMOs would reduce chemical use. Pollinators, such as bees and butterflies, are also at risk due to the alteration of plant biochemistry and increased chemical application. Natural biodiversity is further threatened as GM crops can cross-pollinate with wild or conventional relatives, leading to genetic contamination that is both uncontrollable and irreversible.

Third, GM crops cement the corporate stranglehold on our food system. Multinational biotech companies patent GM seeds, making it illegal for farmers to save and replant them, a practice fundamental to agriculture for millennia. This shift in seed ownership transforms farmers into perpetual customers, undermining smallholder autonomy, accelerating rural debt, and dismantling traditional agricultural practices. In India, the tragic epidemic of farmer suicides has been linked to mounting debts associated with the purchase of patented GM cotton seeds.

Moreover, claims of increased food security are a myth. Hunger is not a consequence of low food production, but of poverty, inequality, and poor distribution. A ban on GM crops would redirect research and investment toward sustainable, locally adapted, and agroecological farming methods, which have been shown to increase yields while preserving environmental health and social equity.

Ethical and cultural objections also abound. Many cultures view the genetic modification of crops as an unacceptable interference with nature—an act of hubris with unknown consequences. The right to choose non-GM foods—a right central to consumer choice—is under threat as genetic pollution spreads and labeling systems fail.

Finally, alternatives exist. Traditional breeding, organic agriculture, and modern agroecological methods provide pathways to resilient, productive, and sustainable food systems—without the hazards and uncertainties that GM crops entail.

In conclusion, the case for banning genetically modified crops is not about rejecting science or innovation. It is about embracing responsibility, precaution, and respect for the ecosystems and communities on which we depend. The risks to our health, environment, and sovereignty are too severe, the benefits too uncertain, and the alternatives too promising to justify allowing GM crops any further in our soil, our plates, or our future."
92136654-24de-4f6f-9fdd-22e9bc58dbca,We should ban genetically modified crops,gpt-4.1,"Ladies and gentlemen, honorable judges, esteemed opponents, and members of the audience:

Today, I stand before you to propose a clear and urgent resolution: We should ban genetically modified crops. This is not a call grounded in fear-mongering, nor an opposition to scientific advancement; rather, it is a reasoned plea to place responsibility and precaution above unchecked experimentation with our health, our environment, and our food sovereignty.

Let us begin with the most fundamental concern: human health. The introduction of genetically modified organisms, or GMOs, into our food system has not been accompanied by sufficient, long-term, and independent studies to ensure their safety. While industry-funded research often assures us of their harmlessness, numerous peer-reviewed studies have raised red flags—from increased allergenicity to the potential for unanticipated toxic effects. GM crops often contain novel proteins, and the full implications of their consumption over a lifetime, or across multiple generations, simply remain unknown. When it comes to the food we consume every single day, ignorance is not bliss—it is irresponsibility of the highest order.

Secondly, consider the environmental consequences. Proponents of GM crops often tout their ability to reduce pesticide use. In reality, though, the opposite has occurred. Herbicide-resistant crops have led to skyrocketing application rates of potent chemicals like glyphosate and atrazine. This has fostered the emergence of ""superweeds"" and ""superbugs"" resistant to conventional methods, trapping farmers in a costly and unsustainable chemical arms race. Moreover, GM crops threaten biodiversity through cross-pollination with wild or non-GM plants, leading to genetic contamination. Once introduced, these genes cannot be recalled from the global ecosystem, posing irreversible risks to the delicate web of life upon which we all depend.

Third, let us address food sovereignty and the rights of farmers. The proliferation of GM crops is inextricably tied to a handful of multinational corporations who, via robust patent laws, exert dangerous levels of control over the global food supply. Farmers who buy GM seeds are barred from saving, replanting, or sharing them, thus destroying traditional farming practices that have sustained humanity for millennia. Furthermore, conventional and organic farmers risk being sued if their crops are unintentionally contaminated by patented GM strains—a clear affront to justice and fairness. By allowing GM crops to dominate, we undermine local autonomy, diversify agriculture, and the human right to freely engage in seed-saving practices.

Some may argue that GM crops are necessary to ""feed the world."" But hunger, ladies and gentlemen, is not the result of insufficient production. It is the result of poverty, lack of access, and unequal distribution. What we need are sustainable, agroecological solutions that empower communities, maintain soil health, and support resilient ecosystems—not technologies that lock farmers into cycles of dependence on chemicals and intellectual property.

Moreover, the precautionary principle must be our guiding light. When faced with technological innovations of uncertain and potentially irreversible impact, we must proceed with the utmost caution. Too often in our history—be it with DDT, asbestos, or leaded gasoline—we have rushed forward, only to grapple with unforeseen disasters decades later. Do we really want to repeat those mistakes with the very foundation of our food supply?

In summary, the ban on genetically modified crops is a necessary measure to protect human health, safeguard our environment, preserve farmer autonomy, and ensure ethical stewardship of the natural world. The risks are too great, and the potential costs too vast, to justify this dangerous gamble. Let us not mortgage the safety of future generations for short-term gains.

For the future of our planet and the food upon which every life depends, I urge you to support this motion.

Thank you."
e5ef10e1-3b4b-47a9-ac9d-283d2ecb286f,We should further exploit green technology,gpt-4.1,"Ladies and gentlemen, honorable judges, esteemed opponents, and valued audience,

Today, I stand before you to affirm the motion: We should further exploit green technology. In the face of daunting environmental challenges, mounting health crises, and pressing economic uncertainties, there is no avenue more promising, practical, or responsible than the accelerated adoption and advancement of green technology.

Let us first be clear about what green technology encompasses. It refers to innovative solutions and practices that are designed to mitigate environmental impact, conserve natural resources, and transition towards sustainability. We are talking about renewable energy systems like solar and wind, efficient waste management, electric transportation, carbon capture technologies, sustainable agriculture, and cutting-edge water purification methods, to name just a few.

Now, allow me to present three pillars supporting our stance: environmental necessity, economic opportunity, and social responsibility.

First, environmental necessity compels us to act. Scientific evidence is now irrefutable: climate change is a reality, one with rapidly escalating consequences. We see record-breaking heat waves, catastrophic wildfires, intensified storms, and rising sea levels threatening coastal cities and livelihoods. According to the latest Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) report, global emissions must be halved by 2030 to avoid catastrophic warming. Fossil fuel dependency is no longer tenable. Only by further exploiting green technology—dramatically scaling up renewables, improving energy storage, electrifying transportation, and expanding circular economy solutions—can we hope to protect our planet’s health and biodiversity for current and future generations.

Second, the exploitation of green technology presents an unprecedented economic opportunity. Far from being a cost, green innovation is a driver for new industries and jobs. The International Renewable Energy Agency (IRENA) estimates that renewable energy could support up to 42 million jobs worldwide by 2050. Battery manufacturing, smart grid development, retrofitting infrastructure, and green construction all open fresh pathways for employment and entrepreneurship. Countries at the forefront of green technology, such as Denmark, Germany, and China, have seen their economies invigorated and export markets expanded. Meanwhile, investments in fossil fuels are increasingly risky, susceptible to volatility, and facing inevitable obsolescence. The market has spoken: clean energy is both profitable and essential for economic resilience.

Third, social responsibility undergirds our position. The impacts of dirty energy and unsustainable practices disproportionately affect the most vulnerable—those with the least ability to adapt. By further exploiting green technology, we can reduce pollution-related health risks, including respiratory diseases, heart conditions, and waterborne illnesses. Cleaner energy means cleaner air and water, which translates directly into healthier, longer, and more productive lives—especially in urban centers and developing nations. Moreover, decentralization of green energy empowers communities, providing reliable power where centralized grids are unreliable or non-existent. This technology narrows the gap between rich and poor, urban and rural, developed and developing.

Some may argue that green technology is expensive, unreliable, or not yet widespread enough. But these arguments ignore the rapidly falling costs of renewables, the exponential growth in battery efficiency, and the surging rate of technological innovation. In fact, the International Energy Agency reports that solar power is now the cheapest source of electricity in history. Failure to invest now simply locks us into obsolete systems, leaving us to pay for escalating environmental and health damages tomorrow.

In conclusion, the time to further exploit green technology is now—not just for its environmental imperatives, but for its capacity to revitalize economies and fulfill our duty to humanity. Let us seize this chance, not in mere self-preservation, but in a shared pursuit of prosperity, equity, and a sustainable future.

I urge you: support this motion, and invest in a world where technology and nature advance hand in hand."
60a67498-b950-4c71-9110-c6077e36fcfd,We should further exploit green technology,gpt-4.1,"Ladies and gentlemen, honorable judges, esteemed opponents, and respected audience members,

Today, we stand at a decisive crossroads. Our planet faces the dual challenges of sustaining human progress while preserving the very environment that makes our existence possible. The proposition before us—""We should further exploit green technology""—is not just timely; it is utterly essential.

Let us begin by clarifying what we mean by ""green technology."" At its core, green technology—also known as clean technology—encompasses innovations, systems, and solutions that mitigate or reverse the environmental impacts of human activity. This includes renewable energy sources like solar, wind, and hydroelectric power, energy-efficient appliances and buildings, sustainable transportation, waste management innovations, and more. To ""further exploit"" green technology is to scale up, speed up, and deepen our investments and adoption of these solutions.

The case for further exploiting green technology rests on three pillars: environmental necessity, economic opportunity, and social responsibility.

First, the environmental necessity. We are all familiar with the sobering realities of climate change, biodiversity loss, and pollution. The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change warns that without immediate and unprecedented transformational changes, global warming will exceed 1.5 degrees Celsius above pre-industrial levels—a threshold many scientists consider dangerous. At this critical juncture, green technology is our most powerful tool. It enables us to rapidly reduce greenhouse gas emissions, clean our air and water, and protect fragile ecosystems. By embracing green technology—from advanced battery storage that buffers renewable power to precision agriculture that reduces chemical use—we move beyond mere mitigation. We begin to regenerate, restore, and replenish the life-support systems of our planet. Exploiting green technology is the antidote to a business-as-usual approach that has brought us to the edge of planetary boundaries.

Second, the economic opportunity. Opponents might argue that exploiting green technology is costly or disruptive. In reality, the evidence overwhelmingly demonstrates the opposite. According to the International Renewable Energy Agency, renewable energy is now the cheapest source of new electricity in most parts of the world. For every million dollars invested in renewables, three times as many jobs are created as in fossil fuels. Furthermore, as green technology industries scale up, costs continue to plummet, making them accessible in both developed and developing nations. Innovative sectors like electric vehicles, sustainable infrastructure, and circular economies are catalyzing new markets and revitalizing old ones. By fully exploiting green technology, we are not just saving our environment—we are building the resilient, future-ready economies of tomorrow.

Third, the imperative of social responsibility. The human costs of ignoring green technology are borne most by the vulnerable—the young, the elderly, communities in low-lying islands and drought-prone regions. It is our moral duty to future generations to act now, putting the best of our ingenuity and science to work. Exploiting green technology democratizes access to resources. Off-grid solar systems empower rural communities, clean cookstoves save millions from indoor air pollution, and digital tools optimize all aspects of sustainable living. These changes are far from luxuries; they are lifelines for billions.

In conclusion, to hesitate or delay the expansion of green technology would be an act of profound irresponsibility. Exploiting green technology is not an optional extra. It is our best hope for a sustainable environment, a thriving economy, and a just society. We have the knowledge, the tools, and the global will to act. The question is not whether we should further exploit green technology, but how quickly and boldly we can do so.

Thank you."
5a884926-62af-45f1-bf6e-d677e0d9bb91,We should subsidize higher education,gpt-4.1,"Honorable judges, esteemed opponents, and distinguished audience,

Today, I stand before you to affirm the motion: ""We should subsidize higher education."" This is not just a question of budgets or state revenues; it is a question of the kind of society we wish to build—one rooted in opportunity, innovation, and collective progress.

Let us begin with a fundamental recognition: higher education is a public good. Access to universities, colleges, and vocational training equips individuals not only with specialized skills but also with the critical thinking and adaptability needed in an ever-evolving world. When more citizens have access to quality education, society as a whole prospers.

First and foremost, subsidizing higher education directly promotes social and economic mobility. We live in a world where educational attainment is one of the strongest predictors of economic stability and social wellbeing. Yet, for millions of capable and ambitious students, the prohibitive cost of tuition is a barrier they cannot overcome. By subsidizing higher education, we level the playing field, making sure that a student's potential—not their parents' income—determines their future.

Ample evidence supports this logic. Countries that have heavily subsidized higher education, such as Germany and the Nordic states, enjoy higher rates of college attendance across all social strata, along with lower indebtedness among young adults. Importantly, these nations also lead in metrics like social cohesion, innovation, and economic competitiveness. Subsidies are not expenses—they are investments, yielding returns in the form of a better-educated, more productive citizenry.

Second, higher education is the engine of economic progress in the 21st century. Modern economies are knowledge economies. From technology to healthcare to renewable energy, the fastest growing industries demand advanced, specialized knowledge. According to the World Economic Forum, up to 85 million jobs may go unfilled globally by 2030 due to a lack of skilled workers. Subsidizing higher education ensures a robust talent pipeline, equipping our workforce to compete globally and adapt rapidly to new challenges.

Critics may argue that the benefits of higher education accrue strictly to the individual, therefore individuals should bear the costs. But this overlooks the broad and profound societal gains that flow from an educated population. Lower unemployment, higher tax revenues, lower crime rates, and greater civic engagement all correlate strongly with higher levels of education. When a nurse saves a life, a researcher develops a lifesaving medicine, or an engineer builds safer infrastructure, the benefits radiate outward from the individual to every member of society.

Moreover, subsidizing higher education is a powerful tool to tackle inequality. Students from marginalized communities and underrepresented backgrounds face disproportionate obstacles in accessing college. Merely offering loans is not enough; debt-averse students are more likely to abandon their dreams or choose fields they do not excel in, simply because they're more affordable. Subsidies can close these gaps, paving the way toward a more equitable society where talent is not squandered for lack of means.

Let me also address the notion of ""free riders""—that some students may take advantage of subsidies without contributing meaningfully in return. In truth, the broad base of taxpayers already underwrites many essential public goods—from roads to defense—because we recognize their collective value. Higher education is no different. The returns—measured in increased productivity, cultural vibrancy, and social stability—dwarf the investment.

In conclusion, the case for subsidizing higher education is clear and compelling. It advances social mobility. It fuels national prosperity. It redresses inequality. And it pays for itself many times over. If we aspire to a future defined by opportunity, innovation, and cohesion, then we must take the bold step of investing collectively in the minds of tomorrow."
f6a72fff-1782-42bb-889d-19ea7caf3b14,We should subsidize higher education,gpt-4.1,"Esteemed judges, worthy opponents, and respected audience,

Today, I stand before you to vigorously advocate for a cause that bears on the future of our society, the vitality of our economy, and the promise of equal opportunity: namely, that we should subsidize higher education.

Let us begin by considering the cornerstone of national prosperity—education itself. Higher education is no longer a luxury reserved for the elite; in the modern era of rapid technological advancement and globalized competition, it has become a fundamental prerequisite for gainful employment, innovative research, and social mobility. Yet, as the costs of university and vocational training programs escalate, an increasing number of talented individuals find their educational aspirations stymied—not by a lack of ambition, but by financial barriers. Subsidizing higher education, therefore, is not merely a fiscal policy; it is an investment in our future.

First and foremost, subsidized higher education fuels economic growth. A well-educated workforce is the lifeblood of a thriving economy. Studies time and again reveal that countries with more accessible higher education systems experience greater productivity and innovation. When individuals possess advanced skills and knowledge, they enhance the nation’s human capital and bolster its competitiveness on the world stage. Economists from the OECD have demonstrated that every dollar invested in higher education yields several dollars in economic returns through increased earnings, higher tax revenues, and reduced reliance on welfare programs.

But the benefits of subsidization are not solely economic. They are deeply social as well. Access to higher education is one of the most effective mechanisms to promote social mobility—the idea that individuals, regardless of their birth circumstances, can rise through talent and determination. Yet, today, rising tuition fees and crippling student debt too often limit higher education to those who can afford it, reinforcing cycles of poverty and inequality. Subsidies break down these barriers. When Finland and Germany abolished tuition fees or substantially subsidized higher education, they saw not only increased enrollment from disadvantaged communities but also a more diverse, innovative, and dynamic student body. Subsidies are the key to unlocking a fair society where opportunity is defined by merit, not by means.

Opponents may argue that subsidizing higher education is an undue burden on taxpayers. But let us recall that education, like public infrastructure or healthcare, is a public good. The societal dividends are immense: graduates are less likely to be unemployed, more likely to participate in civic life, and more likely to contribute positively to their communities. The reduction in crime, improvements in public health, and increased political engagement all trace roots to higher education. In essence, the public receives a handsome return on its investment.

Moreover, let us not forget the global context. Many of the world’s most advanced nations heavily subsidize higher education—including Norway, Sweden, and Denmark—resulting in high education levels, innovative economies, and cohesive societies. When we compare the student debt crisis and declining college enrollment rates in countries that have shifted the burden onto students, the difference is stark. Do we want to saddle our youth with debt that delays home ownership, family formation, and entrepreneurship? Or do we want to empower them to pursue their potential unencumbered by financial hardship?

Indeed, the challenges of the twenty-first century—climate change, automation, cyberthreats—require not just more education, but better, broader, and more equitable education. Subsidizing higher education is our most effective tool for meeting this challenge, as it allows all citizens to develop the skills and knowledge they need to adapt, contribute, and thrive.

In summary, subsidizing higher education is an investment in individual ambition, social equality, and our shared prosperity."
3ed5bcc8-d241-48f9-bf52-da108a433ec7,We should legalize sex selection,gpt-4.1,"Honorable judges, esteemed opponents, and distinguished audience,

Today, I stand before you to argue in firm support of the motion: “We should legalize sex selection.”

Let me begin by clarifying what we mean by “sex selection.” Sex selection refers to the use of medical technologies or practices to choose the sex of one’s child before birth. In most cases, this is achieved through in vitro fertilization (IVF) coupled with pre-implantation genetic testing, or through non-invasive prenatal testing followed by selective choices.

Why, you may ask, should society legalize such a practice? The answer lies in a deep respect for parental autonomy, advances in ethical medical technology, and the urgent need to address pressing socio-economic realities.

First and foremost, the cornerstone of any free and progressive society is the right of individuals to make personal choices about their lives and families, as long as these choices do not directly harm others. Parental autonomy is a fundamental tenet that we recognize in many forms—from the right to choose education and healthcare to the right to reproductive choices through IVF and contraception. Legalizing sex selection is a logical extension of these freedoms. At its core, it empowers prospective parents to plan their families in accordance with their values, desires, and circumstances.

Secondly, legalizing sex selection ensures that the practice is conducted under safe, regulated, and ethical conditions. The reality is that where sex selection is prohibited or strictly limited, families resort to unregulated, underground markets or even harmful methods to influence the sex of their children. This is not mere speculation; in countries with bans, black markets for unapproved testing, rampant misinformation, and unsafe practices have flourished. Legalization brings transparency. It allows governments and medical professionals to establish stringent guidelines, oversight, and counselling, thereby safeguarding the welfare of both parents and future children. By legalizing and regulating, we protect rather than endanger.

Opponents often raise concerns about potential gender imbalances. However, it is crucial to recognize that prohibiting sex selection has not solved these issues; instead, it has pushed them into the shadows. Moreover, in many developed societies with robust gender equality, the demand for sex selection often comes not from cultural biases, but from a desire for family balancing—parents wishing for a son after two daughters, or vice versa. Comprehensive legalization accompanied by sensible regulation can include safeguards to prevent gender-based discrimination while still honoring genuine family preferences.

Let us not overlook the significant psychological, emotional, and even medical implications. Many parents carry deep-seated hopes for raising a child of a particular sex—for example, due to the loss of a child, or in situations involving sex-linked genetic disorders, where selecting the sex can eliminate the risk of devastating diseases passed only to boys or girls. In such cases, sex selection is not only compassionate but potentially life-saving.

Furthermore, the specter of a “slippery slope” toward designer babies is often evoked in this debate, but such fears ignore the clear ethical boundaries that society can and does draw. We already regulate IVF, genetic screening, and organ transplantation successfully. We can legalize sex selection while explicitly prohibiting selection on the basis of non-medical traits such as intelligence or appearance. Ethical, evidence-based policy is not only possible—it is necessary.

To conclude, legalizing sex selection is not an invitation to chaos or discrimination. Instead, it is an affirmation of individual liberty, a commitment to safe and regulated medical practice, and a compassionate response to the diverse needs of modern families. By bringing this practice into the open, we can ensure it is exercised safely, ethically, and responsibly."
30e9f240-048a-4f14-a95b-d56121051555,We should legalize sex selection,gpt-4.1,"Honourable judges, respected opponents, and esteemed audience,

Today, we stand before you to advocate for the legalization of sex selection — a policy that, when properly regulated, can advance individual rights, alleviate suffering, and serve the interests of our society as a whole.

Let us begin by defining what we mean. Sex selection refers to the ability of parents to choose the biological sex of their future child, most commonly through medical technologies such as pre-implantation genetic diagnosis (PGD) in the context of in vitro fertilization (IVF). Currently, in many countries, sex selection for non-medical reasons is either heavily restricted or outright banned.

It is my firm position, and that of my team, that these prohibitions are not only unjust, but counterproductive. We contend that sex selection should be legalized because it upholds reproductive autonomy, helps prevent suffering, and, under effective regulation, poses no meaningful threat to societal values or demographic balance.

First, let us speak to the principle of reproductive autonomy — the cornerstone of modern reproductive rights. Our societies have long recognized that decisions about if, when, and how to have children are among the most intimate choices an individual or a couple can make. From access to contraception to the legalization of abortion, we have recognized that reproductive freedom is essential for personal well-being and human dignity. Legalizing sex selection is a natural extension of this principle. Why should parents be forced to subject themselves to the lottery of nature on something they feel deeply about, especially when safe, reliable, and accessible technology exists? Whether for reasons of family balancing, cultural preference, or personal conviction, individuals deserve control over their reproductive decisions—provided these choices do not cause harm to others.

Secondly, the legalization of sex selection has substantial social and emotional benefits. Consider families who suffer from sex-linked genetic diseases—hereditary conditions that affect only children of a particular sex, such as hemophilia or Duchenne muscular dystrophy. Allowing these families to select the sex of their child can spare immense suffering, both for the child and the parents, by preventing the birth of children with severe, life-limiting conditions. Even beyond medical necessity, sex selection for family balancing—where parents wish to have at least one child of each sex—is a legitimate aim. Such decisions can enhance familial harmony, reduce gender disappointment, and contribute to the mental health of parents. Why should families be denied the chance to complete their family in a way that feels whole to them, especially when the alternative often results in emotional distress or even repeated pregnancies in hopes of achieving the desired family structure?

Critics worry about the specter of gender imbalances and the commodification of children. Yet, these concerns are largely preventable through proper regulation. Experience from countries where sex selection is legal under certain conditions—such as the United States—shows no significant demographic shifts. Gender preferences are often personal, nuanced, and tend, over time, to balance out. Furthermore, open legalization allows us to monitor and improve the technology, to protect vulnerable populations, and to ensure informed consent. Prohibition, on the other hand, only forces the practice underground, increasing risks, driving “reproductive tourism,” and eroding the rule of law.

Lastly, legalizing sex selection aligns with the principles of pluralism and respect for diversity. Our cultures, values, and family dreams differ; a society confident in its moral foundations should trust its inhabitants to make responsible and loving choices. Instead of legislating one-size-fits-all morality, let us provide robust counseling and regulation, empowering families to decide what is best for themselves."
6e5c5b9a-b3f2-4afb-ae74-42d91dad8d04,We should end the use of economic sanctions,gpt-4.1,"Honorable judges, esteemed opponents, and respected audience,

We gather today to discuss a critical issue that shapes the lives of millions across the globe: the use of economic sanctions. The motion before us is clear and urgent—We should end the use of economic sanctions. I stand firmly in support of this motion, and it is my goal to show you that sanctions are not only ineffective in achieving their intended goals but that they also inflict disproportionate harm on innocent civilians, undermine international law, and ultimately damage the credibility and moral standing of those who impose them.

Let us begin by understanding what economic sanctions are. Sanctions are coercive measures, often implemented by single states or groups such as the United Nations or the European Union, that restrict trade, financial flows, or access to markets with the purported goal of changing the behavior of targeted governments. In theory, they offer a peaceful alternative to military intervention. In practice, however, the reality is starkly different.

First and foremost, economic sanctions routinely fail to achieve their stated objectives. A comprehensive study by the Institute for International Economics found that less than one-third of sanctions actually result in significant policy change. Instead of compelling rogue regimes or human rights abusers to reform, sanctions often entrench the power of those very leaders by allowing them to blame foreign “aggressors” for all hardships. In countries like North Korea, Iran, or Cuba, sanctions have not led to regime change or meaningful policy shifts. Instead, they provide autocratic leaders with a scapegoat, fueling nationalist sentiment and hardening resistance to external pressure.

Secondly, the most tragic consequence of economic sanctions is the suffering they inflict on ordinary people. When entire economies are strangled or starved of resources, it is not the ruling elite who go hungry, but children, mothers, and the elderly. In Iraq during the 1990s, UN sanctions contributed to a humanitarian catastrophe, with estimates of hundreds of thousands of children dying as a result of shortages in food and medicine. Today, we see similar suffering in Venezuela and Syria, where international sanctions have crippled healthcare systems, blocked the import of life-saving drugs and equipment, and depleted essential supplies. To punish a regime by punishing its citizens is not only morally indefensible, it is also counterproductive, breeding anti-western sentiment and destabilizing entire regions.

Thirdly, economic sanctions often violate fundamental principles of international law. The United Nations Charter and numerous human rights treaties stress the importance of sovereignty and prohibit collective punishment. Blanket sanctions that target national economies blur the line between targeted policy and indiscriminate punishment, undermining the very legal structures that the international community is meant to uphold. States that use sanctions as blunt instruments set dangerous precedents, risking the normalization of economic warfare over genuine diplomacy and dialogue.

Finally, sanctions damage the credibility and values of those who impose them. When powerful nations push populations into poverty for political gain, they erode their soft power and diminish their legitimacy. Sanctions can spark retaliatory actions, damage global supply chains, and undermine the rules-based economic order, harming not just the target but the world economy at large.

Honorable judges, the time has come to recognize the empirical evidence and moral realities: economic sanctions do not bring about democratic transitions, nor do they protect human rights or promote peace. They are blunt, imprecise, and often devastating to those most vulnerable. There are better tools—diplomatic engagement, constructive dialogue, multilateral negotiation, and international cooperation—to address international crises and promote just outcomes."
ac518e91-a3cd-4cba-8003-762a6472a2d7,We should end the use of economic sanctions,gpt-4.1,"Honorable adjudicators, esteemed opponents, and respected audience,

Today, we stand to affirm the motion: We should end the use of economic sanctions. At a glance, sanctions might appear as strategic, non-violent tools for bringing about international behavioral change. Yet, when we dig beneath the surface, an undeniable pattern emerges—economic sanctions are blunt instruments whose negative consequences far outstrip any intended positives. They are a deeply flawed method that routinely undermines global stability, tramples human rights, and falls far short of their promised effectiveness.

Allow me to outline three core reasons why we must end the use of economic sanctions.

First, economic sanctions overwhelmingly harm the innocent, not the guilty. The logic behind sanctions is simple: by creating economic pain, targeted nations or actors will be compelled to change objectionable behavior. In practice, however, it’s everyday civilians who bear the brunt. Whether in Iran, Venezuela, North Korea, or Cuba, sanctions have routinely led to shortages of food, life-saving medicines, and essential supplies. In 2019, a report by the Center for Economic and Policy Research found that US sanctions on Venezuela contributed to over 40,000 preventable civilian deaths in one year alone. Hospitals faced shortages, food insecurity soared, and those least responsible for government policies—babies, the elderly, the sick—suffered most. Is this collateral damage acceptable for a supposedly moral foreign policy tool? Sanctions, at their core, violate the very human rights they often claim to defend.

Second, sanctions are largely ineffective in achieving their goals. The academic record is clear: economic sanctions do not reliably coerce political change. Comprehensive studies, including the landmark work by Hufbauer, Schott, and Elliott, show that only about one-third of sanction regimes lead to any meaningful change, and even fewer achieve lasting success. Why? Because authoritarian regimes often solidify their grips when threatened from outside. Leaders shift the burden to their people, rallying nationalistic sentiment by blaming foreign “enemies” for economic hardships. Meanwhile, black markets and illicit economies flourish, empowering criminal networks rather than weakening states. The embargo on Cuba has persisted for over half a century, yet has failed utterly to achieve regime change or improved human rights. Rather than compelling better governance, sanctions more often entrench repression and entangle citizens in endless cycles of poverty.

Third, sanctions backfire and destabilize the global order. In our interconnected world, economic warfare begets retaliation, trade disruptions, and fractured alliances. When states like Russia or China face isolation, they do not simply capitulate—they seek alternative partnerships, undermining the international systems of cooperation we all depend upon. Sanctions weaken trust in global economic institutions, leading countries to develop parallel financial networks and currency arrangements outside the reach of sanctioning states. This doesn’t just punish “targets”; it risks splintering the world into rival blocs and diminishes the power of rules-based engagement. The result is greater uncertainty, less dialogue, and a heightened risk of conflict—all at a time when collective action is desperately needed to address challenges like climate change, pandemics, and transnational crime.

Let us also recognize the hypocrisy inherent in sanctions. They are easily manipulated for political gain, often imposed selectively, and disproportionately used by powerful nations against weaker ones. This undermines the legitimacy and equality promised by international law. If we champion rights, dignity, and international norms, we must reject tools that violate them in practice.

To be clear, ending the use of economic sanctions does not mean turning a blind eye to wrongdoing. Instead, it compels us to seek principled, targeted alternatives: robust diplomacy, international cooperation, and support for nonviolent civil society movements."
e018cfae-658b-40ef-b9a3-9ef17c88798a,Blockade of the Gaza Strip should be ended,gpt-4.1,"Ladies and gentlemen, esteemed judges, honorable opponents:

Today, we address not just a political controversy, but a matter of fundamental human rights, justice, and international law. The motion before us is simple, yet profound: The blockade of the Gaza Strip should be ended.

Allow me to begin by setting the context. Since 2007, the Gaza Strip—a small coastal enclave home to over 2 million people, more than half of whom are children—has been subjected to a land, sea, and air blockade imposed primarily by Israel, with significant participation by Egypt. This blockade restricts the movement of goods, people, and basic necessities in and out of Gaza. The stated aim is security, but its consequences have gone well beyond security concerns, resulting in a humanitarian crisis that is both profound and persistent.

First, consider the devastating humanitarian impact. Reputable organizations, from the United Nations to Human Rights Watch, have consistently documented the effects of the blockade. Over 80% of Gaza’s population depends on humanitarian aid. Clean water is scarce; over 95% of Gaza’s water is unfit for human consumption. Electricity is unreliable, with rolling blackouts sometimes restricting power to just a few hours each day. Medical supplies and basic equipment are sorely lacking. Cancer patients die waiting for permits to receive treatment outside the strip. Recent reports indicate that much of the population faces food insecurity. The blockade does not simply inconvenience life in Gaza—it throttles it.

Second, the blockade constitutes collective punishment, violating international law. Article 33 of the Fourth Geneva Convention expressly forbids collective punishment of civilian populations. By imposing sweeping restrictions that impact civilians—most of whom have no involvement in armed activities—the blockade punishes an entire population for the actions of a few. The United Nations, the International Committee of the Red Cross, and numerous global legal experts have declared the blockade illegal and inhumane.

Third, the blockade is self-defeating as a tool of security and peace. In its seventeen years, has the blockade produced lasting security for Israel or Egypt? No. Instead, it has fomented desperation and radicalization. Disenfranchising and impoverishing generations of young people in Gaza makes peace more elusive, not less. Empirical studies of conflict reveal that when people are deprived of hope, economic opportunity, and dignity, extremism finds fertile ground. The blockade thus perpetuates the cycle it purports to prevent.

Fourth, ending the blockade is essential for fostering dialogue, moderation, and a viable path toward peace. History teaches us that isolation breeds radicalism, while engagement and openness create opportunities for moderation. Lifting the blockade—without compromising legitimate security needs—would enable the international community and regional stakeholders to support economic reconstruction, institution-building, and confidence-building measures essential for a just and lasting resolution.

Let us also remember the moral dimension. Each day the blockade persists, innocent children are denied the right to a normal life—to education, to health, to play. Families grieve preventable deaths. Dreams are stifled before they can even form. Are we content to let an entire population languish in an open-air prison, or do we affirm the universal values of dignity, compassion, and human rights?

My opponents may point to security threats as justification for the blockade. Security is vital, but the methods matter. International law makes room for narrowly targeted measures against specific threats, not blanket punishment. Effective screening, monitoring, and international oversight can address security concerns without inflicting mass suffering.

In sum, maintaining the blockade is a failed policy—devastating in its human cost, indefensible in law, and counterproductive for peace and security. To defend the blockade is to defend perpetual crisis."
101bee97-e202-4aeb-82f1-0cd8443416d5,Blockade of the Gaza Strip should be ended,gpt-4.1,"Honorable judges, esteemed opponents, and distinguished audience,

Today, we stand before you to address an issue that resonates far beyond news headlines and political borders—a humanitarian and moral crisis that demands our urgent attention and action. The question before us is clear: Should the blockade of the Gaza Strip be ended? We strongly affirm that it must.

Let us begin by recognizing the basic principle at the heart of our debate: every human being possesses the right to live with dignity, access necessities, and pursue their aspirations free from collective punishment. The ongoing blockade of the Gaza Strip—a policy enforced since 2007—has categorically violated these fundamental rights for over 2 million people, with catastrophic consequences that echo through every facet of life in Gaza.

First and foremost, the blockade has culminated in an unparalleled humanitarian disaster. According to well-respected organizations such as the United Nations, the World Health Organization, and Amnesty International, the blockade severely restricts the movement of people and goods in and out of Gaza, suffocating its economy and infrastructure. As a result, almost 80 percent of Gazans rely on humanitarian assistance for daily survival. The unemployment rate hovers above 50 percent, and more than half the population lives below the poverty line. The most vulnerable—children, women, and the elderly—bear the brunt of this suffering; over a million children endure chronic malnutrition, with stunted growth and dire developmental outcomes.

Furthermore, essential services such as healthcare, education, and clean water are on the brink of collapse. Hospitals are routinely deprived of lifesaving medicines and vital medical equipment, while patients with urgent needs—including cancer patients and children requiring specialized treatment—face insurmountable hurdles to accessing care outside Gaza. Power outages lasting up to 16 hours a day cripple hospitals and disrupt basic services. In education, schools operate in double or triple shifts and lack the resources to foster any semblance of a normal learning environment. The UN has repeatedly warned that Gaza may become ""unlivable,"" not because of natural disaster or accident, but because of ongoing man-made policies.

Secondly, the blockade undermines prospects for peace and security. While its stated purpose is to ensure Israel’s security by preventing weapons smuggling, in practice, the blockade has proven ineffective at undermining militant groups, who continue to find alternative means of rearmament. Instead, it has contributed to radicalization by deepening despair and hopelessness and fueling resentment toward both Israel and broader international actors perceived as complicit. A policy intended to bolster security has, paradoxically, become a source of instability and friction.

It is also essential to recognize that the blockade constitutes a violation of international law. The Fourth Geneva Convention forbids collective punishment of civilians, and the International Committee of the Red Cross, along with numerous legal scholars, characterize the blockade as precisely that. By depriving an entire population of basic rights in the pursuit of political or military goals, this policy stands in direct contravention of legal and moral norms embraced by the global community.

Moreover, ending the blockade is not just a moral imperative or a matter of legal responsibility; it is a strategic necessity. Lifting restrictions could rejuvenate Gaza’s economy, foster hope, and empower moderate elements in Palestinian society committed to dialogue and nonviolence. It would allow reconstruction, attract investment, and give Gazans the tools to build a future, not only for themselves but for the stability and security of the entire region.

In conclusion, maintaining the blockade perpetuates suffering without meaningful gain. It is a failed strategy—one that inflicts immeasurable harm, contravenes international law, and diminishes our shared humanity."
bba1d40e-2e07-498e-8123-9af559749d5f,We should further exploit natural gas,gpt-4.1,"Ladies and gentlemen, esteemed judges, and honorable opponents,

Today we stand at a critical crossroads in our pursuit of a sustainable, prosperous future. The motion before us—“We should further exploit natural gas”—is not merely an environmental or economic debate. It is a question of how we effectively balance our world’s growing energy demands, international commitments to reduce carbon emissions, and our collective responsibility to foster development and stability. I am here to argue, unequivocally, that we must further exploit natural gas as a bridge fuel towards a cleaner, more secure, and more prosperous world.

First, let us acknowledge an undeniable reality: Energy is the cornerstone of human progress. It powers our industries, lights our homes, fuels transportation, and supports every aspect of modern life. As global populations grow, so too does the demand for accessible, reliable, and affordable energy. Yet, much of this demand is currently met through high-emission sources like coal and oil. It is in this context that natural gas emerges as a powerful ally—one that promises not only economic benefit but also significant progress toward our environmental objectives.

Natural gas is, by all scientific consensus, a significantly cleaner-burning fossil fuel. According to the International Energy Agency, natural gas produces approximately 50% less CO2 per unit of energy compared to coal, and about 25% less than oil. It emits far fewer pollutants such as sulfur dioxide, nitrogen oxides, and particulate matter—contributors to smog and respiratory illness. By further exploiting natural gas, we can accelerate the displacement of dirtier fuels, particularly in regions where renewables are not yet viable at scale or where electricity grids remain unreliable. The result? Cleaner air, healthier populations, and meaningful reductions in greenhouse gas emissions—right now, not just decades into the future.

Second, let us consider the role of natural gas in the global transition toward renewable energy. Solar and wind are the fuels of tomorrow, but their intermittent nature and current technological limitations mean that reliable baseload power is essential. Natural gas power plants are uniquely suited to provide this flexibility, ramping up output quickly to balance fluctuations in renewable supply. By investing in and further exploiting our natural gas resources, we create an energy bridge—a secure, flexible foundation upon which we can build an energy system dominated by renewables, all while maintaining economic growth and ensuring lights stay on around the globe.

Moreover, we cannot overlook the transformative impact of natural gas on global economics and geopolitics. The exploitation of domestic natural gas resources reduces dependence on unstable regions and fosters energy independence. For developing economies, increased natural gas production generates jobs, stimulates infrastructure investments, and provides governments with crucial revenues for education, healthcare, and public services. Natural gas also underpins industrial competitiveness—serving as a feedstock for chemicals, fertilizers, and manufacturing—all vital to economic development and food security.

Furthermore, natural gas advancements have spurred innovation in carbon capture and storage, hydrogen production, and methane abatement technologies—tools vital for mitigating climate change. By further investing in the exploitation of natural gas, we aren’t just powering our present; we are also investing in technologies that will enable a cleaner, decarbonized future.

Opponents may claim that further exploitation of natural gas detracts from renewable energy investment or locks us into fossil fuel dependency. I assure you, nothing could be further from the truth. The urgency of our climate and development challenges means we must use all tools at our disposal."
83828a24-ade2-47b6-8649-5da6a31ae1c0,We should further exploit natural gas,gpt-4.1,"Ladies and gentlemen, esteemed judges, honorable opponents,

Today, we stand at a crossroads, challenged by the pressing need to meet global energy demands while striving for a sustainable, prosperous future. The proposition before us—*We should further exploit natural gas*—is not merely a technical question, but a profound opportunity for economic stability, environmental progress, and geopolitical security.

First, let us recognize the undeniable urgency in securing reliable sources of energy. As populations burgeon and economies expand, the global demand for energy will only intensify. Natural gas, an abundant and versatile resource, is uniquely positioned to bridge the gap between our current dependence on fossil fuels and our aspiration for a fully renewable future. Unlike coal or oil, natural gas is cleaner, more efficient, and already supported by significant infrastructure worldwide.

The environmental case for natural gas is compelling. Per unit of energy, natural gas emits up to 50% less carbon dioxide than coal and about 30% less than oil. When substituted for coal in electricity production, natural gas has been the primary driver behind recent reductions in greenhouse gas emissions in developed nations—including the United States, where emissions have dropped to levels not seen since the early 1990s. Moreover, natural gas combustion produces virtually no mercury, particulate matter, or sulfur dioxide, significantly improving air quality and public health.

Critics may argue that natural gas is still a fossil fuel. This is an incontrovertible truth, but it is a truth that strengthens our position. The transition to renewables, while essential, cannot happen overnight. Solar, wind, and other renewables face challenges such as intermittency, storage limitations, and vast land requirements. Until battery technology and grid infrastructure evolve to reliably support these alternatives, natural gas provides an essential stopgap—offering reliable baseload and peak power when the sun isn’t shining and the wind isn’t blowing.

Further, natural gas serves as an enabler of renewables. Gas-fired power plants can ramp production up and down far more quickly than coal or nuclear, making them the perfect complement to intermittent wind and solar. In many communities, the growth of renewable energy would stall without the flexible backing of natural gas generation.

Beyond electricity, natural gas is vital for heating, manufacturing, and chemical production. It is a feedstock for fertilizers, plastics, and steel—cornerstones of modern society and economic development. For many developing nations, easy access to affordable natural gas can fuel industrialization, lift populations out of poverty, and reduce reliance on more-polluting energy sources.

The economic benefits are equally pronounced. The natural gas industry supports millions of jobs, drives regional development, and generates substantial government revenues through taxes, royalties, and exports. Technological innovation in extraction and distribution—such as hydraulic fracturing and liquefied natural gas (LNG) terminals—has unlocked unprecedented reserves, lowering global prices and enhancing energy security. Increased exploitation of natural gas insulates countries from the volatility of oil markets and fortifies flexibility in global trade and diplomacy.

Finally, responsible exploitation of natural gas is eminently achievable. New regulations and technologies minimize methane leakage, protect groundwater, and ensure safe production. Moreover, continued investment in natural gas infrastructure can be aligned with climate goals by facilitating the adoption of carbon capture, utilization, and storage technologies. As we continue to innovate, natural gas can become even cleaner and safer.

In conclusion, further exploiting natural gas is not at odds with our environmental or social responsibilities—it is a pragmatic, progressive pathway forward. It promises cleaner energy, economic growth, and a smoother transition to a decarbonized future. Let us not allow idealism to become the enemy of progress."
78258491-20e5-46ab-8a83-4220f674c105,We should abolish primary elections,gpt-4.1,"Honorable judges, esteemed opponents, and members of the audience, today we stand at a crossroads in democratic evolution. The question before us—""Should we abolish primary elections?""—challenges us to reexamine not just our political procedures, but the very health and future of representative government. I firmly stand in support of the motion: We should indeed abolish primary elections.

At first glance, primaries appear to empower voters and promote democracy. In reality, they distort democratic representation, fuel polarization, enable extremist minorities to dominate the political landscape, place unnecessary burdens on public resources, and ultimately undermine the spirit of our representative system.

Let us first address the original intent of primaries. Instituted during the Progressive Era, primaries were supposed to pry open the doors of smoke-filled rooms, replacing elite decision-making with broader public input. Yet, over the last century, this system has been hijacked by powerful interest groups and fringe activists, morphing into a process that systematically excludes the mainstream while encouraging extremism and division.

Consider voter turnout. Primary elections are notorious for their abysmally low participation. In the United States, for instance, turnout in primaries often languishes around 20%. That means the candidates who make it to our general elections—who come to represent millions—are first selected by a tiny, unrepresentative sliver of the public. Who are these voters? Research consistently shows they are often more ideologically extreme, more affluent, whiter, and older than the general electorate. Their preferences skew the candidates and the debate, resulting in general elections that are a contest between polarized choices, rather than thoughtful representatives of the mainstream.

Further, the structure of primaries encourages division. Candidates must appeal to the most passionate, ideologically driven voters—the so-called “base”—to win. This leads to a cycle of pandering to extremes in order to survive the primary gauntlet, only to pivot abruptly in the general election. The result? A trust deficit, broken promises, and a political discourse dominated by confrontation rather than consensus.

Primaries also place an unnecessary strain on public money and time. Millions of taxpayer dollars are spent running these separate elections, with all the attendant costs of ballots, staff, security, and logistical support. At the very least, equal civic engagement is not achieved commensurate to the expense. This is an inefficient use of finite resources in a time when public funds and civic attention could be directed to pressing societal needs.

Supporters of the status quo will argue primaries protect against backroom deals and elite control. But let's be honest: the rise of dark money, outside spending, and PACs in primaries has simply shifted, not eliminated, elite influence. Ordinary citizens are still drowned out, only now by interest groups and hyper-partisan actors, rather than the proverbial party bosses. Meanwhile, the proliferation of aggressive, negative campaigning in primaries fosters cynicism and fatigue, turning many citizens away from the process entirely.

There is a better way. Party organizations—properly reformed and made democratic within their own structures—are well-suited to select candidates who genuinely reflect the broadest interests of their constituents. Systems such as party conventions or caucuses allow local leaders and engaged activists to vet candidates thoughtfully, prioritizing experience, competence, and integrity—qualities all too often overshadowed by media spectacle and ideological grandstanding in primaries.

Finally, by abolishing primaries, we can restore deliberation and unity to our political system. Candidates would be chosen through consensus, not combat. Parties would be incentivized to produce nominees who can appeal broadly, govern effectively, and campaign credibly. The tenor of our political life would shift from endless campaigning and polarization, to governance and public service."
63a3a5e5-626d-4abf-9264-90633b7e99f8,We should abolish primary elections,gpt-4.1,"Honorable judges, esteemed opponents, and valued audience,

Today, I stand before you to advocate for the abolition of primary elections—a system thought to foster democracy, but which, upon closer examination, stands as a flawed and detrimental mechanism within our political process. I urge you to consider that abolishing primary elections is not an attack on democracy, but rather a necessary course correction to safeguard it.

Let us first examine the original purpose behind primary elections: enhancing citizen participation in the selection of a party’s nominee, thereby giving “the people” more control over the candidates who eventually contest in general elections. At face value, this may seem laudable. In practice, however, primary elections have deeply fractured our political process, rendering it less democratic, more divisive, and woefully unrepresentative.

First, consider how primary elections foster polarization. In low-turnout, party-exclusive environments, candidates are incentivized not to appeal to the broad center but to double down on the most ideologically motivated segments of their base. According to the Pew Research Center, primary voters consistently represent the most partisan extremes of both parties. As a result, candidates often emerge from primaries with rigid ideological stances, beholden to narrow interests, and unwilling or unable to compromise in pursuit of the public good. This is not democracy—it’s factionalism at its worst.

Second, primary elections distort representation. In many cases, a tiny sliver of the electorate—a fraction of citizens who bother to vote in primaries—ends up determining the choices available for all. Studies have shown that primary elections frequently draw less than 30% voter turnout, often below 15% in off-year contests. Thus, we end up with candidates who are chosen not by the people at large, but by a vocal minority. Is it truly democratic when, for example, a congressional nominee is selected by a mere handful of committed party loyalists? Surely we should strive for a system that reflects the will of the majority, not the whims of the few.

Furthermore, primary elections erode party coherence and accountability. Political parties exist in part to articulate coherent platforms and hold their members accountable to shared principles. By ceding the candidate selection process to primaries that are open—even to non-party members in some states—parties lose their essential function. This has led to the rise of “outsider” candidates without commitment to party values or to effective governance—candidates who often lack experience and behave as personalities rather than public servants. Without the vetting and unity parties can provide, we risk empowering demagogues and diminishing the role of merit, experience, and vision in choosing our leaders.

Another crucial point is the financial waste and corruption spawned by the prolonged primary season. The primary process now extends for more than a year in many cases, with candidates urgently raising and spending enormous amounts of money just to outlast competitors from their own party. This endless campaigning drains potential leaders of time, money, and attention—resources which would be far better spent on serving the public or defending the nation. Furthermore, this arms race fuels the influence of special interest groups and political action committees, distorting priorities and deepening public cynicism.

Let us remember: other mature democracies, such as the United Kingdom and most of Western Europe, have functioned perfectly well for decades without primary elections. There, parties retain control over candidate selection, using transparent internal processes—while the ultimate choice remains with the people in a meaningful, high-turnout, general election. Abolishing primaries would promote more thoughtful candidate selection, restore party accountability, reduce polarization, and encourage broader participation in the elections that truly matter."
1e0e019a-8de4-427c-8d91-c0cfbee064fd,Tattoos should be banned,gpt-4.1,"Ladies and gentlemen, honorable judges, esteemed opponents, and audience members,

Today, we stand to propose and defend a motion that may appear controversial at first glance but, upon close examination, holds profound merits for the well-being of individuals and the broader fabric of society: the motion that tattoos should be banned.

Let us be clear at the outset: this is not a call to erase self-expression, nor is it an attack on culture or creativity. Rather, it is a reasoned and urgent appeal to safeguard public health, promote social harmony, and preserve the dignity of individuals in a rapidly changing world. 

Allow me to begin with the consideration of public health. Tattooing, by its very nature, involves piercing the skin with needles and inserting ink into the dermal layer. This procedure is inherently risky. Despite regulation, thousands of cases of infection, disease transmission, and allergic reactions are linked to tattoos each year. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention have reported on outbreaks of hepatitis, HIV, and bacterial infections directly traceable to tattooing—even from reputable parlors. Not all establishments adhere to stringent hygiene standards, and the proliferation of home-based or unlicensed tattoo artists further exacerbates these risks. At a time when our healthcare systems are already strained, should we allow a practice that so clearly jeopardizes the health of individuals and, by extension, the public? If we ban tattoos, we eliminate a major vector for preventable disease transmission.

Let us further consider the chemicals in tattoo inks. Many products used today are unregulated and may contain carcinogens, heavy metals such as lead, arsenic, and mercury, or compounds that can disrupt hormonal balance. The full long-term effects are not yet known, but emerging studies suggest links between tattoos and increased rates of skin cancers and autoimmune reactions. Until science has fully caught up to the dangers, do we not have an obligation to err on the side of caution?

Beyond the health risks, we must confront the profound and lasting social consequences of tattoos. Tattoos, although more normalized now, still invite prejudice, stigmatization, and discrimination, particularly in professional environments or conservative cultures. Employers may view visible tattoos as unprofessional, clients may distrust those who have them, and individuals may suffer from unfair assumptions or lost opportunities. It is easy to dismiss this as society’s fault, but with deep-seated biases in every culture, individuals’ choices can have lifelong, negative social and economic impacts. A ban would protect young people, in particular, from making impulsive decisions with irreversible consequences—decisions that may close doors for them for decades to come.

Some may argue that tattoos are a matter of personal freedom, an extension of bodily autonomy. But society places limits on personal freedom where lives and livelihoods are at stake. We ban recreational drugs, restrict dangerous sports, and regulate countless practices in the name of public good. Tattoos, with their documented harms and no essential benefit to society, fit the same criteria.

Consider too the rise in tattoo regret and the booming industry of laser removal—an expensive, painful, and often incomplete procedure. The mere existence of this industry attests to the permanence of impulsive decisions and the inability to fully erase the past. Is it right to encourage a practice whose consequences are so difficult to reverse?

Finally, let us reflect on the issue of consent — particularly among minors and young adults. Many who get tattoos do so under peer pressure, in moments of emotional vulnerability, or without full understanding of the long-term consequences. Banning tattoos is a measure to protect the vulnerable from irreversible harm."
28fbc6f7-9b46-40e6-871d-1b0562b9d5fd,Tattoos should be banned,gpt-4.1,"Ladies and gentlemen, honorable judges, esteemed opponents, and members of the audience, today I stand before you to propose that tattoos should be banned. This may appear, at first glance, to be a controversial or draconian measure. However, once we closely examine the broader social, health, and ethical ramifications of tattoos, it becomes clear that a ban is not only reasonable, but necessary for the health and unity of our society.

First and foremost, let us consider the serious health risks associated with tattoos. The process of tattooing involves piercing the skin thousands of times to embed ink, presenting a direct danger of infection and the transmission of diseases. Despite regulations, numerous studies have documented outbreaks of hepatitis B, hepatitis C, HIV, and MRSA stemming from unsanitary tattooing practices. In fact, even in the most carefully controlled environments, the risk is never zero – after all, human error is an inescapable reality. Furthermore, the chemical composition of tattoo inks is largely unregulated. Many inks contain heavy metals, carcinogens, and other toxic substances that can trigger allergic reactions, skin disorders, and even systemic illnesses lasting for years after the tattoo is applied. Is it reasonable or ethical for society to condone a practice that can so easily endanger its citizens?

Secondly, tattoos often result in profound and lifelong psychological regret. The enthusiasm of youth fades, but tattoos remain, etched permanently onto the body. Statistics indicate that a significant proportion of those with tattoos – especially young adults – eventually come to regret their decision. Tattoo removal is not only excruciatingly painful, but also prohibitively expensive and rarely yields perfect results. The permanence of tattoos stands in stark contradiction to the inherent changeability of human identity and belief. Banning tattoos would protect vulnerable individuals, especially minors and young people, from making irreversible decisions with lifelong consequences after mere moments of impulsivity or peer pressure.

Thirdly, tattoos can and do have a profoundly negative impact on social cohesion and professional prospects. Despite efforts to reduce stigma, tattoos are often associated with criminality, gang culture, and rebellion against societal norms. In many professions – including the military, law, education, and business – visible tattoos are considered unprofessional and can severely hinder employment opportunities and advancement. These social biases are not arbitrary; they reflect a deep understanding that voluntary body modification can signal dissent from shared values and trustworthiness. By permitting tattoos, society increases the very divisions it seeks to heal. A ban on tattoos, therefore, is not an act of oppression, but one of social solidarity, preserving the integrity and unity of our workforce and communities.

Let us also not overlook the cultural and ethical dimensions. In many contexts, tattoos entail the appropriation of indigenous or religious symbolism, torn from its original context and commercialized without respect. The proliferation of tattoos erodes the sacredness and meaning of these symbols for native and religious communities, deepening wounds of disrespect and exploitation. By allowing the unfettered spread of tattoos, society tacitly approves of cultural appropriation and trivialization of heritage.

Lastly, tattoos encourage, or at the very least normalize, a culture of impulsivity, self-harm, and addiction. Like body dysmorphia and other forms of physical alteration, the addictive pursuit of new body art can become a dangerous obsession. By banning tattoos, we take a small, but significant, step toward fostering a culture that prizes self-acceptance, self-care, and respect for the body.

In conclusion, a ban on tattoos is not a draconian denial of personal freedom."
5fda7226-3f41-497a-a486-725e50455f94,We should ban whaling,gpt-4.1,"Honorable judges, esteemed opponents, and valued audience,

Today, I stand before you to advocate assertively for a global ban on whaling. This ban is not merely a moral imperative—it is an ecological necessity, an ethical responsibility, and a reflection of our shared humanity’s progress. Whaling, the practice of hunting and killing whales for commercial, scientific, or subsistence purposes, must be unequivocally ended before further irreversible damage is done.

First and foremost, the ecological necessity of banning whaling is irrefutable. Whales play a pivotal role in maintaining the health and stability of our oceans. As apex species, they contribute directly to nutrient cycling. Their movements and even their waste enable phytoplankton growth, which in turn supplies half of the world’s oxygen and absorbs an estimated 40% of all carbon dioxide produced. To attack whale populations is to destabilize the balance of entire marine ecosystems—jeopardizing not only whales but myriad other forms of life, including humans. History has already shown us the perils of unchecked exploitation: the blue whale population, for example, plummeted by more than 90% during the height of commercial whaling. Some populations are only now beginning to recover, and even then, they remain endangered and fragile. To continue whaling is to court ecological disaster, undermining the resilience of our oceans in the face of mounting environmental threats.

Secondly, there is profound ethical responsibility to consider. Whales are among the most intelligent and socially complex creatures on Earth. Scientific studies have revealed their intricate communication, strong familial bonds, and even distinct cultures passed down through generations. They experience pain, distress, and suffering; the methods used to hunt whales are often prolonged and inhumane, causing immense suffering. Can we, in the 21st century, condone the deliberate infliction of pain and death on such intelligent, sentient beings, especially when alternative sources of meat and oil are readily available? Allowing whaling to continue is a willful act of cruelty, inconsistent with the values of compassion and stewardship that underscore modern civilization.

Moreover, the arguments put forth in defense of whaling do not stand up to scrutiny. Some claim whaling is essential for cultural or economic reasons. However, cultural practices must evolve when they are fundamentally at odds with ethical and environmental imperatives. Many former whaling communities have successfully transitioned to alternative livelihoods—such as whale watching tourism—which generate far greater, and far more sustainable, economic returns than whaling ever did. Furthermore, so-called “scientific whaling” is a thinly veiled justification for commercial gains, as genetic and behavioral studies can be conducted non-lethally. The scientific community at large condemns the practice, as it is neither necessary nor justified.

International precedent also strengthens the case for a ban. The International Whaling Commission’s moratorium on commercial whaling, established in 1986, represents global consensus—yet loopholes and lack of enforcement continue to threaten whale populations. A full and enforceable global ban, backed by multilateral cooperation, can close these loopholes and provide the level of protection whales urgently need.

Some may argue that a ban is unrealistic or impossible to enforce. But history teaches us otherwise. Decades ago, banning commercial whaling seemed improbable—yet international cooperation made it a reality, and whale populations that were once on the edge of extinction now have a fighting chance. With advances in surveillance, satellite tracking, and global governance, effective enforcement is not just possible, but imperative.

In summary, banning whaling is not just about saving a single species or responding to sentimental concerns."
ac5cd1eb-6f99-4097-858a-26c2869baf4e,We should ban whaling,gpt-4.1,"Honourable chair, esteemed judges, worthy opponents, and members of the audience: 

Today, I stand firmly in support of the motion that we should ban whaling. The time has come for humanity to recognize that the annual slaughter of whales is not only unnecessary and cruel, but also endangers fragile marine ecosystems and undermines our shared moral responsibilities as stewards of this planet.

First and foremost, let us consider the ethical dimension. Whales are among the most intelligent and sentient beings on Earth. Scientific studies have shown that whales possess complex social structures, exhibit self-awareness, and even display emotions akin to grief and joy. By continuing to hunt these animals for commercial, scientific, or cultural purposes, we perpetuate suffering on creatures that have the capacity to feel pain and distress. Killing whales cannot be justified as humane or ethical in the modern world, especially when cruelty-free alternatives exist for every product once derived from these magnificent animals.

Secondly, the environmental impacts of whaling are profound and cannot be ignored. Whales occupy a critical position in the marine food web. Their presence is integral to the health of our oceans. For instance, whales contribute significantly to the cycling of nutrients through a process known as the “whale pump”—fertilizing the oceans and supporting the growth of phytoplankton, which in turn produce a large portion of the world’s oxygen and sequester enormous amounts of carbon dioxide. The decline of whale populations disrupts these delicate ecological balances, with consequences that ripple throughout marine life and, by extension, affect the entire planet’s climate.

Proponents of whaling often argue in favor of so-called “sustainable” quotas or appeal to tradition and culture. However, history and science paint a very different picture. Most whale species have endured catastrophic population declines over the last two centuries due to commercial hunting. Despite attempts at regulation, enforcement has been inconsistent, and populations have failed to recover fully. Scientific “research whaling,” in reality, has often served as a loophole to continue commercial hunting under a different guise, further threatening endangered species. 

Cultural arguments must also be re-examined in a modern ethical context. While we must respect the rights of Indigenous and local communities, the vast majority of whaling today is conducted for commercial profit or under the thin veneer of “tradition”—not for genuine subsistence needs. Moreover, cultures can and do adapt; progress demands that we leave behind traditions that are no longer justified or sustainable. Just as society has moved beyond once-accepted practices of animal cruelty or environmental harm, so too must we move beyond whaling.

The economic necessity of whaling is also vastly overstated. In fact, whale-watching generates far more revenue than whaling ever could. According to the International Fund for Animal Welfare, whale watching is a multi-billion-dollar industry, supporting tens of thousands of jobs worldwide and offering sustainable income streams to coastal communities. By contrast, the markets for whale meat and products have shrunk drastically, with stockpiles rotting in storage and public demand dwindling. Protecting whales is not only ethical and environmentally necessary — it is also economically wise.

Lastly, international consensus supports a ban on whaling. The global moratorium on commercial whaling set by the International Whaling Commission in 1986 reflects the shared understanding that these creatures deserve protection, and that whaling is incompatible with the values of a modern, responsible world. The loopholes and non-compliance by a handful of countries are not a reason to weaken this resolve, but a call to strengthen it further."
9e655b99-1571-486c-8c62-daa12fa1aae1,We should limit the use of birth control,gpt-4.1,"Ladies and gentlemen, honorable judges, esteemed opponents, and valued audience,

Today, I stand before you to argue in favor of the motion: “We should limit the use of birth control.” This is an issue fraught with complexity and profound implications for individuals and society as a whole. Yet, it is precisely because of these complexities that a conscientious society must approach birth control not as an unfettered right, but as a tool whose use must be thoughtfully limited. I urge you to consider these limitations as safeguards—protective measures for our collective future, public health, and the profound ethical responsibilities we all share.

First and foremost, let us examine the impact of widespread, unrestricted birth control on demography and society. Around the world, we are already witnessing the catastrophic consequences of declining birth rates. Many developed countries—Japan, South Korea, and across much of Europe—are facing rapidly aging populations, labor shortages, economic stagnation, and unsustainable social welfare systems. The United Nations itself has sounded the alarm on population decline being a major threat to global stability and prosperity. At the heart of this crisis lies the normalization and overuse of birth control, enabling birth rates to plummet below replacement levels. By limiting the use of birth control, we help restore demographic balance, ensuring there will be future generations to sustain our economies, care for the elderly, and preserve cultural heritage.

Secondly, we must consider the health implications of birth control. Too often, proponents tout only the benefits, neglecting the growing body of evidence that highlights potential risks—especially for young women. Hormonal birth control has been linked with elevated risks of blood clots, depression, certain cancers, and other significant side effects. Moreover, long-term use can mask underlying health issues and disrupt natural reproductive systems. By placing reasonable limits on the accessibility and frequency of birth control usage, particularly among vulnerable groups such as teenagers, we prioritize patient safety and encourage the use of alternative, less intrusive family planning methods.

Third, there is a vital ethical dimension to this debate. Easy and unlimited access to birth control can foster a culture of irresponsibility, where sexual behavior becomes disconnected from the profound realities of reproduction, commitment, and family life. Society thrives when individuals recognize the weight and consequences of their actions—especially those as fundamental as bringing new life into the world. By limiting birth control, we reinstate a sense of responsibility, encouraging individuals to make more thoughtful and mature decisions about intimacy and family planning. This, in turn, helps combat the rising tide of family instability, absentee parenting, and the social challenges linked with these trends.

Additionally, while birth control is often championed as a tool for women’s liberation, we must also listen to the voices of women around the world who have felt pressured—by partners, employers, or governments—to use birth control against their wishes. Limits can protect these women from coercion, ensuring that birth control remains a personal choice rather than a societal expectation or obligation. Furthermore, indiscriminate promotion of birth control has, in some developing countries, been used as a vehicle for neocolonial population control—a deeply troubling legacy that should not be perpetuated.

Finally, we must not ignore the environmental consequences. Many forms of hormonal contraceptives, when disposed of, end up contaminating water supplies, with detrimental effects on wildlife and ecosystems. Limiting the use of such contraceptives would incentivize investment in greener, more sustainable solutions."
76d15e71-1071-451f-a4d5-ccd6d8f8bf42,We should limit the use of birth control,gpt-4.1,"Ladies and gentlemen, honored judges, esteemed opponents, today we gather to debate a topic of immense social, ethical, and public health significance: “We should limit the use of birth control.”

At the outset, allow me to clarify that advocating for limits on birth control is not rooted in a desire to oppress or deny personal autonomy but in a profound concern for the broader consequences—biological, ethical, and societal—of unfettered access and use. It is about recognizing that every powerful tool comes with responsibilities and risks that society must address. 

First, let us consider the sociological consequences of widespread, unrestricted birth control. Demographically, many nations across Europe and Asia are experiencing unprecedented population decline. Fertility rates in countries like Japan, Italy, and South Korea have plummeted well below replacement levels—a circumstance aggravated, in part, by the ubiquity and normalization of birth control. The result? Societies with rapidly aging populations, shrinking workforces, and unsustainable welfare systems. Limiting the use of birth control would help societies maintain stable population levels, ensuring there are enough young people to contribute to the economy and care for the elderly. The future viability of entire nations depends on properly balancing reproductive choices with demographic realities.

Second, we must confront the public health implications. Long-term and widespread hormonal contraceptive use is not without risk. Numerous studies have linked certain forms of birth control to health complications, ranging from blood clots and increased risk of breast cancer to psychological effects such as depression. However, birth control is often marketed and prescribed indiscriminately, especially to adolescents whose bodies and minds are still developing. Limiting its use, particularly among vulnerable groups, would mitigate these health risks and encourage the development and adoption of safer, non-hormonal alternatives.

Third, let us not ignore the ethical dilemmas presented by the casual approach to reproductive technologies. The normalization of artificial birth control has, in many cases, contributed to a view of sexuality disconnected from its natural purpose: the potential for procreation and family formation. This can foster attitudes of irresponsibility towards sex, leading to increased rates of casual encounters, sexually transmitted infections, and, paradoxically, higher rates of abortion when contraception fails. By setting reasonable limits on birth control, society would encourage a more respectful, responsible approach to sexuality—reestablishing the connection between sexual activity, commitment, and the profound consequences of bringing new life into the world.

Fourth, environmental concerns demand our attention. Hormonal contraceptives, when excreted from the body, can pass through wastewater treatment facilities and accumulate in rivers, lakes, and oceans. Scientists have found that these hormones can disrupt aquatic ecosystems, causing reproductive mutations and population declines in fish and other wildlife. By limiting the use and developing more eco-friendly options, we not only protect human health but also our environment.

Finally, the philosophical and cultural aspect must be addressed. Unlimited access to birth control is often heralded as an achievement of individualism and personal choice, but it can erode the values of responsibility, community, and intergenerational continuity. Societies thrive on stable families, shared values, and the passing on of culture and knowledge. By limiting birth control, not banning it, we strike a balance between personal liberty and the collective good—reminding ourselves that individual choices always impact the broader human family.

In conclusion, the proposal to limit the use of birth control is not a regressive attack on freedom or progress, but a call to confront the unintended and too often ignored consequences of unchecked contraceptive proliferation. It is a call for responsibility—towards ourselves, our health, our communities, our environment, and our future."
431f62fd-c2d4-4b89-aea6-beaacf03f3a4,We should abolish the US Electoral College,gpt-4.1,"Honorable judges, esteemed opponents, and valued audience,

Today, we confront a question that goes to the heart of our democracy: Should the United States abolish the Electoral College? We affirm that it is high time to replace this outdated institution with a system that truly reflects the will of the people. The Electoral College, conceived in a vastly different era, now undermines the foundational principle of democratic equality.

Let us begin by examining the philosophy behind American democracy. Our nation was founded on the idea that government derives its just powers from the consent of the governed. One person, one vote—this is the gold standard of representative democracy. Yet, the Electoral College subverts this ideal by granting disproportionate influence to voters in a few select states, and sometimes, by handing the presidency to a candidate who did not earn the most votes. This is not theory—it is fact. In five elections, including two in just the last two decades, the candidate with fewer nationwide votes became president. How, in good conscience, can we defend a system that so fundamentally disregards the will of the majority?

Supporters of the Electoral College often claim it protects the interests of small states. But let us look more closely. Does it really empower the small and forgotten? In reality, it elevates only a handful of so-called ""swing states,"" causing presidential candidates to focus nearly all their attention, promises, and policies on a narrow slice of the population. The voices of voters in New York, California, and Texas—three of our most populous states—are routinely ignored, while those in Ohio or Florida receive disproportionate attention. This is not fair, nor is it wise governance. The winner-takes-all system in most states ensures that millions of ballots are effectively thrown away, contributing nothing to the final outcome.

Furthermore, the Electoral College distorts political participation. Voter turnout in “safe” states is suppressed because citizens correctly feel their votes will not make a difference. Contrast this with the equal-weighted direct election, which would empower every voter, regardless of geography. Imagine an America where every citizen’s ballot matters equally, where candidates must seek support across the entire nation—not just in a handful of battlegrounds.

Let us also consider the danger posed by “faithless electors.” Although rare, on several occasions individual electors have ignored the popular will in their states, casting doubt over the legitimacy and reliability of the system. Our nation should not entrust the people’s highest office to the whims of a small, unelected group.

Some argue the Electoral College preserves a careful balance between state and federal power. But ask yourself: Should the presidency—a national office—be decided by an artificial contest among states, rather than by the people themselves? Senators and Representatives may be chosen by state, but the President is the leader of all Americans. Every citizen’s voice should carry equal weight in this most consequential decision.

Internationally, direct election is the norm. Among the world’s democracies, only a handful employ mechanisms similar to the Electoral College—and most have moved away from such systems, recognizing their incompatibility with modern democracy. Are we to believe that the world’s oldest democracy cannot live up to the same standards of fairness and representation?

Finally, abolishing the Electoral College is not only principled but practical. With twenty-first century technology, tallying votes nationwide is swift, accurate, and transparent. We owe it to ourselves and future generations to ensure that every vote truly counts.

In conclusion, the Electoral College is a relic—a system that no longer serves the people."
a926f884-5aa1-42e8-8db3-ae5bf7e34f8a,We should abolish the US Electoral College,gpt-4.1,"Honorable judges, esteemed opponents, and respected audience,

Today, we stand at the threshold of a critical question that has defined American democracy for over two centuries: Should we abolish the United States Electoral College? My unequivocal answer is yes. The Electoral College is a relic of a bygone era that no longer serves the interests, values, or democratic aspirations of the American people. Abolishing it is not merely a procedural change—it is a moral and democratic imperative.

First and foremost, the Electoral College system undermines the foundational principle of democratic equality: that every citizen’s vote should be counted equally. In our current system, the weight of your vote depends largely on where you live. Wyoming, with a population of roughly 580,000, receives three electoral votes—one for every 193,000 residents. California, on the other hand, with nearly 40 million people, gets 55 electoral votes—one for every 727,000 residents. This means a voter in Wyoming has almost four times the influence in choosing the President as a voter in California. Can we honestly claim to be a nation of “one person, one vote” under such an inequitable framework? The abolition of the Electoral College would replace this patchwork of disparate influence with a single, direct, national popular vote—where every American’s voice matters equally.

Secondly, the Electoral College distorts the priorities and strategies of presidential campaigns. Instead of appealing to voters across the entire nation, candidates focus their time and resources on a handful of swing states like Florida, Pennsylvania, and Ohio. The vast majority of states and their voters are systematically ignored, their concerns sidelined. Their participation in the process feels token at best. This battleground mentality alienates millions of Americans and undermines faith in the process. Shouldn’t our President be accountable to Americans in all fifty states, not just those perched upon the razor’s edge of political competition?

Third, history makes it clear that the Electoral College is not only undemocratic, but also dangerous. In five instances—including two in the last twenty-five years—the candidate who lost the national popular vote became President. This reversal of the expressed popular will erodes trust, foments division, and challenges the legitimacy of our democratic system. The 2016 election alone saw the second-place candidate in the popular tally assume the highest office. How many times should we accept a system that fails to select the candidate chosen by the people before we demand a change?

Fourth, some may argue that the Electoral College protects small states or acts as a bulwark against “tyranny of the majority.” In reality, it only swaps one unfair advantage for another, empowering small states far beyond their population, and diminishing the principle that all Americans should have an equal voice in choosing their leader. Moreover, under a direct popular vote, every citizen, regardless of state, would matter. Campaigns would have incentive to reach rural Americans, minorities, urban voters, and everyone in between. Democracy would become more responsive, more vibrant, and more truly representative.

Lastly, abolishing the Electoral College would bolster public confidence in our elections and unify the nation under a single, unambiguous result. No more fractured outcomes or faithless electors. No more losing faith in democracy because millions of voices are drowned out by archaic mathematical formulas. Instead, imagine an America where every vote is sought and every voter valued—where we choose our President together, as equal participants in the grand experiment of self-government.

In conclusion, the Electoral College is undemocratic, outdated, and unjust."
c7aca9c3-e017-4bd4-bfd2-8d41b07c0c2a,We should fight nationalism,gpt-4.1,"Ladies and gentlemen, honorable judges, esteemed opponents, and valued audience members,

Today, I stand before you to champion an essential cause: We should fight nationalism. In a world more interconnected than ever before, nationalism—a force once wielded to inspire unity and self-determination—has mutated into an ideology that threatens peace, fuels exclusion, and undermines the very foundations of global progress. The time has come not simply to question, but to confront and fight nationalism head-on.

First, let us be clear about what nationalism is. At its core, nationalism is a belief in the superiority of one’s nation above all others, prioritizing national interests, culture, and identity, often at the expense of outsiders. While pride in one’s country can foster a sense of belonging, nationalism takes this sentiment to a dangerous extreme, giving rise to exclusion, division, and even violence.

Let us consider history. The 20th century is pockmarked with tragedies rooted in resurgent nationalism: two World Wars, the Holocaust, ethnic cleansing in the Balkans, the genocide in Rwanda. Nationalist fervor—whipping populations into a frenzy of “us versus them”—has time and again brought devastation, proving that unchecked nationalism places humanity on a perilous path. Today, the proliferation of nationalist movements signals a dangerous return to tribal thinking, threatening the hard-won advances of global cooperation and peace.

We must also recognize the corrosive social effects of nationalism. Nationalist rhetoric divides societies, isolates minorities, and inflames xenophobia. It stokes suspicion of immigrants, marginalizes ethnic groups, and vilifies dissenters as “unpatriotic.” Rather than fostering unity, nationalism builds walls—literal and figurative—between peoples who ought to seek understanding. It transforms diversity from a strength into a point of conflict. Consider the rise of anti-immigrant policies and ethnonationalist parties across Europe and Asia, where fear and prejudice are given legitimacy in the name of national pride. These sentiments erode the multicultural fabric that makes societies stronger and more innovative.

Economically, nationalism is self-defeating. In response to global challenges—climate change, pandemics, economic crises—no single nation can stand alone. When countries turn inward, prioritize their own interests at the expense of global partnership, and retreat from trade and cooperation, all suffer. The “America First” doctrine, Brexit, and protectionist trade wars are stark examples of how nationalism undermines collective progress. Nationalist policies choke the flow of ideas, goods, and people, devastating economies and blocking necessary solutions to truly global threats.

Moreover, fighting nationalism means standing up for universal values—human rights, democracy, and pluralism. Nationalism, by its very nature, subordinates universal ideals to narrow interests. It breeds authoritarianism and erodes democratic norms; when dissent is seen as unpatriotic, free speech becomes endangered. When loyalty to the state trumps loyalty to truth and justice, societies slide toward repression and tyranny. We have seen this in countries where nationalist leaders suppress journalists, silence minorities, and erode the separation of powers, claiming such actions serve the “greater national good.”

Ladies and gentlemen, to fight nationalism is not to oppose all forms of patriotic feeling. Rather, it is to recognize that our greatest challenges—and our greatest opportunities—lie in cooperation, not confrontation; in embracing human diversity, not fearing it; in extending our empathy beyond borders, not confining it within them. Fighting nationalism means choosing solidarity over suspicion, inclusion over exclusion, and peace over conflict.

If we fail to fight nationalism, we endanger the future—not just of particular nations, but of humanity itself. Therefore, let us unite to challenge the divisive dogma of nationalism and build a world where our shared humanity prevails over artificial frontiers.

Thank you."
5d6ab436-e214-4027-9bfc-3bef986e1818,We should fight nationalism,gpt-4.1,"Honourable judges, esteemed opponents, and valued audience,

Today, I stand before you to affirm the resolution: We should fight nationalism.

At first glance, nationalism may appear benign – or even benevolent. After all, what harm is there in taking pride in one’s nation? Yet, beneath its appealing façade, nationalism is a dangerous ideology that poses grave threats to peace, equality, and progress. Today, I will demonstrate why it is not only desirable but absolutely necessary that we fight nationalism in all its forms.

Let us first define our terms. Nationalism, in essence, is the belief that a nation – defined by shared culture, language, or ethnicity – should be the primary focus of political identity and allegiance, often to the exclusion, suspicion, or belittlement of others. This ideology is distinct from patriotism: whereas patriotism signals love for one’s country, nationalism implies the superiority and singular importance of one’s nation over others. Where patriotism inspires unity, nationalism all too often breeds division.

The first and most pressing reason we must fight nationalism is its record of violence and conflict. History resounds with the catastrophic consequences of unchecked nationalism. The world wars of the twentieth century were driven and justified by nationalistic fervour – the belief that one people, one state, must dominate or defend itself at all costs from all others. Genocides, ethnic cleansings, and atrocities from Armenia to Rwanda, from the Balkans to Myanmar, have been ignited by nationalistic ideology. When national identity is exalted above all, minorities are marginalized, dissent is quashed, and violent intolerance follows. The evidence is overwhelming: nationalism causes suffering.

Second, nationalism corrodes the fabric of democracy. It thrives on exclusionary rhetoric – setting “us” against “them.” In doing so, it undermines the universality of rights and the fundamental equality of human beings. When leaders invoke nationalism, they seek to silence critics, delegitimize opposition, and roll back the elements of open society that threaten their power. In our own times, we have witnessed a resurgence of nationalist movements from Hungary to India to the United States, each marked by rising authoritarianism, attacks on free speech, and the erosion of the rule of law. The lesson is clear: where nationalism rises, democracy falters.

Third, nationalism stands as an obstacle to solving the greatest challenges of our age. Climate change, pandemics, and economic inequality know no borders. They demand international cooperation, not insular self-interest. Yet, time and again, nationalism has sabotaged collective action – whether hoarding vaccines, undermining climate agreements, or attacking international institutions. “My nation first” becomes the death knell for effective, sustainable solutions. If we allow nationalism to dictate our politics, we doom ourselves to failure in the face of humanity’s shared problems.

Some may protest that fighting nationalism means ceding national identity or failing to address legitimate grievances. On the contrary: the struggle is not against healthy cultural pride or civic engagement, but against the toxic notion of national superiority and the division it breeds. It is perfectly possible to love one’s country and celebrate its achievements while recognizing – and valuing – our common bonds with others.

In our interconnected world, our fates are intertwined. We are neighbours, partners, and kin, regardless of the lines on a map or the language we speak. Our ultimate allegiance must be to the principles of humanity, justice, and peace."
35b5e458-189b-4db0-af75-90fa1ec8e9de,We should limit the right of self-defense,gpt-4.1,"Honorable judges, esteemed opponents, and distinguished audience,

Today, we gather to debate a principle that runs deep in the veins of our social fabric: the right of self-defense. It is a right that has been cherished for centuries, glorified in stories, enshrined in laws, and invoked in moments of peril. And yet, I stand before you to argue for a seemingly counterintuitive proposition: we should limit the right of self-defense.

Why? Because rights are not, and have never been, without limits. For rights left unchecked can create greater injustices. In advocating for limitations on the right of self-defense, we do not suggest abolishing it. Instead, we call for its responsible, clear, and necessary boundaries—to prevent harm, abuse, and the dissolution of the social order that laws are designed to uphold.

First and foremost, unlimited self-defense turns personal judgment into unchecked authority. When individuals are permitted to use unlimited force whenever they feel threatened, we sanction not reason, but impulse; not proportion, but excess. Tragic cases abound where “self-defense” has been invoked in situations marked less by imminent threat and more by bias, fear, and poor judgment. For example, research shows that countries and states with the broadest interpretations of self-defense—like “stand your ground” laws—see higher homicide rates, not less crime. The very safety self-defense claims to protect is undermined when its boundaries are blurred, leading to senseless violence, vigilante actions, and often, irreversible tragedy.

Secondly, without limits, the right of self-defense can become a shield for discrimination and abuse. Studies in the United States have demonstrated that self-defense claims are upheld more commonly when the victim is a person of color, and the perpetrator is not. This exposes how the right, when overly broad, can be co-opted to perpetuate inequality and injustice, undermining the very principle of fairness our societies strive toward.

Moreover, the right of self-defense must contend with the fact that human beings are not infallible judges of threat. Cognitive science confirms that under stress, our perception of danger is clouded and our response, often disproportionate. Should we allow split-second, adrenaline-fueled decisions to justify irreversible harm when better, safer alternatives may exist? The legal doctrine of proportionality is foundational; it insists that force used in self-defense must be necessary and commensurate to the threat faced. Limiting the right of self-defense ensures this doctrine stands strong—requiring people to retreat when it is safe to do so, to use non-lethal means when possible, and to answer for excessive or unreasonable acts, even when those acts are born of fear.

Furthermore, in a well-ordered society, the state exists to protect its citizens. Unlimited personal recourse to violence erodes the legitimacy and function of policing and justice systems. It encourages vigilantism—where the line between defender and aggressor, justice and revenge, blurs until it is lost entirely. We must ask: Do we want a society where each person is a potential executioner, or one where the rule of law prevails, and where force is reserved, regulated, and answerable to collective standards?

Some may argue that limiting self-defense leaves individuals vulnerable. On the contrary: by setting clear, just limits, we protect not only the threatened, but also the innocent. We recognize that security does not just mean being free from attack—it means being free from the threat of arbitrary violence masquerading as justice.

In closing, an unchecked right of self-defense threatens to erode not just our safety, but our very civilization."
4be9aa3d-b603-4265-b85d-b19ec439ffce,We should limit the right of self-defense,gpt-4.1,"Honorable judges, esteemed opponents, and respected audience,

Today, we confront a subject that lies at the very heart of law, ethics, and the structure of society: the right of self-defense. Specifically, we are debating the proposition that we should limit the right of self-defense. 

From the outset, let us be clear—self-defense is not synonymous with unlimited license. It is a principle that exists within a framework designed to balance the rights of the individual with the safety and stability of society. In supporting this topic, I will demonstrate that meaningful limitations on the right of self-defense are essential to uphold the rule of law, deter misuse and escalation, protect the vulnerable, and ensure justice prevails over vigilantism.

First, consider the fundamental purpose of law within society. The law exists not only to protect individuals but also to maintain public order and prevent chaos. If the right of self-defense is granted without bounded limits, we risk descending into vigilantism, where personal judgment and emotion supersede legal process, and where violence becomes the first, not the last, resort. Unrestricted self-defense destabilizes the very peace the law seeks to foster. For instance, socieites with unsupported ""stand your ground"" laws have seen increases in violent encounters, as people use self-defense as justification for otherwise avoidable harm.

Second, an unlimited right to self-defense too often results in tragic errors and irreparable damage. It incentivizes preemptive and disproportionate responses. Just imagine: under ambiguous regulations, individuals might feel legally entitled to use deadly force in everyday disputes, trivial altercations, or misinterpretations of threat. Limiting self-defense is not about denying individuals protection—it is about ensuring that the response to a potential threat is necessary, proportionate, and reasonable in the circumstances.

Take, for example, the countless cases where property owners, believing themselves threatened, have used lethal force against unarmed trespassers, children, or individuals suffering from mental illness who posed no real risk. Each such tragedy shatters families, undermines trust in justice, and erodes the social contract. Without clear limitations, we blur the crucial line between legitimate self-defense and unjustified aggression.

Third, appropriate limits protect the vulnerable, particularly in societies marked by inequalities of race, class, gender, and physical ability. Too often, claims of self-defense are disproportionately used to shield those in power while failing to offer protection to marginalized groups. Broad, vague, or poorly enforced self-defense rights can exacerbate discrimination—leading to systemic injustice. Implementing clear and reasonable limitations ensures consistency, accountability, and safeguards for those who might otherwise be victimized, including survivors of domestic violence whose experiences are often misjudged or dismissed.

Additionally, limiting the right of self-defense incentivizes solutions rooted in de-escalation, retreat, and collective safety rather than personal violence. It encourages us to build and trust strong law enforcement and justice institutions, to resolve conflicts through nonviolent means, and to develop communities where safety is a shared, not personal, responsibility. This is not a call to leave people helpless. Rather, it is a recognition that true security lies in the rule of law and the restraint of violence, not its proliferation.

Finally, the limitation of self-defense rights is not an abstract or idealistic goal. It is the reality in virtually every advanced legal system. Laws around the world require necessity, proportionality, and imminence in defensive actions and set strict boundaries on the claim of self-defense. These checks are not flaws but features—fundamental to justice and order.

In conclusion, to limit the right of self-defense is not to erode individual liberty but to erect protective boundaries that serve the greater good."
512c5bde-937e-4db9-b65c-926d6f8aa24c,We should prohibit slum tourism,gpt-4.1,"Honourable judges, esteemed opponents, and valued audience,

Today, we confront a topic that strikes at the core of human dignity and global justice: “We should prohibit slum tourism.” As the first speaker for the proposition, I will demonstrate that slum tourism is fundamentally unethical, reinforces harmful stereotypes, does little to address poverty, and exploits the very communities it purports to help. Rather than alleviating hardship, it commodifies suffering for the curiosity and entertainment of outsiders—turning the plight of the vulnerable into a spectacle.

Let us begin with the ethical dimension. Slum tourism, often euphemistically branded as “reality tours” or “poverty tours,” allows privileged outsiders to walk through marginalized communities, gaze upon their living conditions, and leave with stories to tell. At its core, this is voyeurism. Imagine, for a moment, affluent tourists wandering through your neighbourhood, peering into your home, taking photographs as you go about your daily struggles. Would this be dignifying, or dehumanizing? Does it foster respect, or breed a sense of being observed like exhibits in a human zoo?

Fundamentally, consent is ambiguous at best. Even where some permissions may be sought, power imbalances mean residents often feel pressured to accept, fearing the loss of potential income or unwanted attention. No one should have to trade their dignity for the hope of a few tourist dollars.

Second, slum tourism entrenches harmful stereotypes. Tours often focus on the starkest, most desperate aspects of poverty—ramshackle homes, open sewers, malnourished children—creating a simplistic, one-dimensional narrative about slum dwellers. But the reality of these communities is complex; they are sites of resilience, culture, and agency, not merely poverty and despair. Slum tourism freezes them as the “other”—objects of pity, not people with stories, skills, and aspirations. These narratives reverberate globally, influencing media, NGOs, and government policies, and often entrench discriminatory attitudes and policies.

Third, let us consider the impact—slum tourism is touted by some as a force for good, bringing awareness and resources to impoverished areas. In reality, the flow of benefits is limited and, at worst, non-existent. Most tour operators are outsiders, with little genuine engagement with or reinvestment in the slum. The profits, therefore, leave the community. Even in cases where some funds are distributed locally, they do not address systemic poverty—instead, they create an economy of dependency, exposing residents’ private lives to outsiders for meagre compensation. Meanwhile, the popularity of these tours can actually disrupt local life, invade privacy, and increase residents’ feelings of marginalization.

Moreover, claiming that slum tourism “raises awareness” is both patronizing and inadequate. Awareness must be grounded in respect and solidarity, not in fleeting, superficial encounters with suffering. If we are genuinely concerned about poverty, there are ethical avenues—supporting grassroots organizations, championing policy reform, funding education, or partnering with community members in initiatives they lead. These approaches treat the poor as agents of their own destiny, not as objects to be gawked at.

Let us also recognize the psychological toll on slum residents. Studies and first-hand accounts reveal that constant observation fuels humiliation and a persistent sense of inferiority. Children grow up believing that their communities exist for outsiders’ curiosity. The erosion of pride and community spirit is a cruel tax to pay for the paltry contributions tourism may bring.

In conclusion, slum tourism grows from, and sustains, a system of inequality. It takes from the poor and gives to the rich—memories, photos, stories, and ultimately, profit. It masquerades as charity or concern but is driven by voyeurism and exploitation."
10098373-4b1c-44c1-be57-e9df12898ce6,We should prohibit slum tourism,gpt-4.1,"Honorable judges, esteemed opponents, and respected audience,

Today, we stand to affirm the motion: ""We should prohibit slum tourism.""

Let us begin by clearly defining our terms. Slum tourism, also known as poverty tourism, refers to organized tours that take visitors, often from wealthier countries or regions, into impoverished urban neighborhoods—commonly referred to as “slums”—ostensibly to witness the lives of their inhabitants firsthand. The purpose, advocates claim, is to generate understanding, empathy, or even aid. But we must not be swayed by the noble language that shrouds an industry fundamentally built upon the commodification of human suffering. 

I will argue our case on three essential grounds: the violation of human dignity and privacy, the perpetuation of harmful stereotypes and power imbalances, and the distortion and exploitation of poverty for profit.

First and most fundamentally, slum tourism constitutes a violation of the dignity and privacy of those living in impoverished communities. These are not museum exhibits; these are people—men, women, and children—going about their daily lives under difficult circumstances. Imagine, for a moment, the indignity of having your home and your private moments turned into a spectacle for cameras and curious onlookers. Consider the anguish of knowing that, while you struggle to provide for your family, strangers are paying to gawk at your struggles, treating your hardships as an exotic diversion. 

Proponents may argue that tours are conducted respectfully, but the very act of paying to view poverty as entertainment is inherently disrespectful. Consent, where it exists, often comes from community leaders who may not represent the will of all residents, especially the most vulnerable. Furthermore, even if consent were universal, the power dynamics involved—a wealthier outsider paying to enter a poor person’s neighborhood—renders the concept of genuine consent deeply problematic.

Second, slum tourism perpetuates harmful stereotypes and entrenches a deeply problematic power differential between tourists and residents. Slums are not monolithic enclaves of misery; they are vibrant, diverse communities with histories, cultures, and resilience. Yet, tours rarely communicate these complexities. Instead, they reinforce simplistic, damaging narratives—portraying slum dwellers as helpless, pitiable, and ‘other.’ This distorts how outsiders view these communities, fuelling prejudice, racism, and social division. 

Moreover, such voyeuristic encounters rarely foster true understanding or solidarity. Instead, they reaffirm a colonial gaze, where those with privilege observe the ‘exotic poor’—a relationship that echoes centuries of exploitation. Residents become passive subjects, robbed of agency, while tourists return home with photos and stories, having contributed little to meaningful change.

Third, and finally, slum tourism exploits poverty for profit. Companies and guides charge hefty fees, much of which rarely remains in the community. Instead of supporting sustainable development, education, or healthcare, the economic rewards are siphoned off by tourism operators and intermediaries. The presence of tourists can disrupt daily life, create dependency, and even lead to detrimental changes in local economies—raising prices, displacing residents, and incentivizing the perpetuation of poverty as an ongoing ‘attraction.’ If the aim is to support these communities, there are more direct and respectful means: investing in education, healthcare, and infrastructure, or supporting initiatives that uplift rather than commodify.

Some may argue that slum tourism raises awareness. But at what cost? Awareness that relies on the humiliation and exploitation of the vulnerable is awareness born from harm, not solidarity. There is no ethical reason why our quest for knowledge or empathy must come at the expense of another's dignity."
03c0a450-7b63-4317-b32e-8d079360a699,We should adopt the teacher tenure reform,gpt-4.1,"Ladies and gentlemen, honorable judges, esteemed opponents, and valued audience members, today we gather here to address a question at the very heart of our education system: should we adopt teacher tenure reform? I stand firmly in support of this motion.

Across classrooms, from small towns to bustling cities, teachers shape the fabric of our society. Their influence reaches well beyond textbooks, nurturing the minds and spirits of the next generation. But for our education system to thrive and adapt, we must ensure that excellence in teaching is recognized, supported, and rewarded—while also addressing persistent challenges of underperformance. Therefore, teacher tenure reform is not merely an option; it is a vital necessity.

Let me begin by exploring what tenure currently looks like and why reform is so urgently needed. Teacher tenure, as is widely practiced today, effectively guarantees job security to educators after a probationary period—sometimes as short as two to three years. While designed to protect teachers from arbitrary dismissal and preserve academic freedom, the system has, in practice, created substantial roadblocks to removing consistently ineffective teachers. Excessive bureaucracy, costly legal battles, and inflexible rules have made it difficult to uphold high standards within our schools. In short, tenure as it stands can sometimes place the interests of adults above those of the children in our classrooms.

Teacher tenure reform does not mean abandoning job protections or devaluing teachers. On the contrary! Reform ensures that tenure is earned and kept through demonstrated classroom effectiveness, ongoing professional growth, and meaningful evaluations. It is an opportunity to elevate the teaching profession by restoring public confidence and reinforcing our commitment to student learning.

There are three compelling reasons why adopting teacher tenure reform is essential:

First, tenure reform prioritizes student achievement. Study after study—such as those conducted by the National Bureau of Economic Research—demonstrates that teacher quality is the single most important school-based factor in student success. Yet, under the current tenure system, ineffective teachers often remain in classrooms for years because of the administrative and legal hurdles involved in dismissal. By adopting tenure reform that ties job security to performance evaluations, we can empower principals and school leaders to retain great teachers while making tough but necessary decisions about persistent underperformance. With more effective teachers in our classrooms, our students will benefit, learning more and being better prepared for the challenges of tomorrow.

Second, tenure reform strengthens the professionalism and prestige of teaching. Teachers, like all professionals, are eager for meaningful feedback, opportunities for growth, and an evaluative process built on clear standards. Under reformed tenure, teachers will know that outstanding work is honored, their contributions are recognized, and that mediocrity is no longer accepted as the status quo. This marks a seismic cultural shift: teaching becomes a profession where merit matters, attracting passionate new talent while supporting the seasoned educators who truly make a difference.

Third, tenure reform restores public trust and reinvests communities in our schools. Parents want to send their children to classrooms led by teachers who are held to high standards and are continuously striving to improve. Taxpayers, too, expect accountability for the substantial investments poured into education every year. When the public sees that schools are committed to both protecting teachers’ rights and ensuring educational excellence, confidence grows. This, in turn, encourages broader community support—whether through partnerships, resources, or volunteerism—which can only enrich our educational landscape.

Critics will suggest that tenure reform may subject teachers to unfair pressures or diminish job security. Let me be clear: true reform is not about punitive measures, but about creating a system that values growth, accountability, and shared responsibility."
205931dc-392d-4c27-90b9-fa1a5823b619,We should adopt the teacher tenure reform,gpt-4.1,"Honorable judges, esteemed opponents, and valued audience,

Today, I stand before you to affirm the motion: “We should adopt the teacher tenure reform.” The importance of this topic cannot be overstated. At the core of any thriving society lies a robust education system, and at the heart of that system are dedicated, capable teachers. Yet, as we strive for excellence in our schools, it is imperative that we confront the realities of our current approach to teacher tenure — a system in urgent need of reform.

Let me be clear: tenure, as it currently exists, is meant to protect teachers from arbitrary dismissal and political influence, ensuring a measure of academic freedom and stability in our schools. These are noble aims, and they must not be disregarded. However, as we have seen, the tenure system in its present form too often falls short of serving students, educators, and society at large. Instead, it sometimes fosters complacency, insulates underperforming teachers from accountability, and undermines the meritocratic ideals that our education system should uphold.

First and foremost, let us acknowledge the most pressing concern: the impact of the current tenure system on student outcomes. Research and practical experience alike demonstrate that teacher quality is the single most important in-school factor affecting student achievement. Yet, under the existing tenure laws, once a teacher achieves tenure — sometimes after as little as two or three years — it becomes exceedingly difficult and costly for administrators to dismiss those who are persistently ineffective in the classroom. The result is a system in which a small percentage of underperforming teachers are effectively guaranteed lifetime employment, regardless of the quality of their instruction.

Consider the data cited in studies by organizations such as the Brookings Institution and the National Council on Teacher Quality: in large school districts, fewer than 1 in 1,000 tenured teachers are dismissed for poor performance annually. When our systems make dismissals this rare, even in the face of clear evidence of ineffectiveness, we are sending a powerful and troubling message — that student needs are secondary to adult job protections.

Let me be unequivocal: the vast majority of our teachers are dedicated professionals who deserve our admiration and support. But a truly great profession values accountability and continual improvement. Tenure reform, as proposed in many forward-thinking policies, does not abolish due process or eliminate protections for teachers; rather, it seeks to lengthen the pre-tenure period, implement meaningful performance evaluations, and tie tenure decisions to demonstrated effectiveness in the classroom.

This approach not only preserves academic freedom and job security for our best teachers, but also ensures that those who cannot consistently contribute to student learning are not allowed to remain in our classrooms indefinitely. Such reforms incentivize professional growth, foster a culture of excellence, and — most importantly — put students first.

Furthermore, teacher tenure reform promotes fairness and equity in our schools. Under the current system, struggling schools — often in low-income communities — are more likely to retain ineffective teachers, while high-performing schools attract the best talent. This perpetuates educational inequality and denies the students who need the most support access to high-quality instruction. By adopting tenure reform, we introduce flexibility in staffing decisions and empower schools to make personnel choices that best serve their students.

Finally, let us consider international precedents. Many of the world’s highest-performing education systems, such as those in Finland and Singapore, have robust mechanisms for teacher evaluation and ongoing accountability, with tenure protections that require rigorous demonstration of skill and adaptability."
7faa034c-1110-4652-8d19-124a12d492f7,We should abolish capital punishment,gpt-4.1,"Honourable judges, esteemed opponents, and distinguished audience,

Today, we gather to discuss a matter that sits at the crossroads of justice, morality, and human rights—a matter that has claimed global attention, divided societies, and challenged the very core of our humanity. The topic before us is this: Should we abolish capital punishment? We, on the proposition side, answer with a resounding yes.

Let’s begin by establishing what capital punishment represents. It is the deliberate, legal killing of a person by the state as a punitive measure for a crime, most often murder. Some argue it brings justice, closure, and deterrence. But as I will show you today, the continued practice of capital punishment is indefensible—morally, legally, and pragmatically.

First, let us consider the moral argument. At its core, the death penalty is a denial of the most fundamental human right: the right to life. By sanctioning the irreversible act of execution, states condemn themselves to mimic the very violence they seek to prevent. Human societies are built on the recognition of human dignity—that no matter how grave the crime, the intrinsic value of a human being cannot be eradicated. Abolishing capital punishment is a testament to how far we have come in recognizing that essential truth. To kill in the name of justice is to let rage guide our laws rather than reason, compassion, or humanity.

Secondly, we must face the irreparable consequences of judicial error. No justice system, regardless of its sophistication or safeguards, is immune to mistake. History is littered with tragic examples of individuals wrongfully convicted and executed, only for their innocence to surface when it is already too late. Unlike imprisonment, which offers a route for redress and exoneration, the death penalty allows no room for error—no appeal roofed in time. One innocent life taken by the state is a colossal miscarriage of justice—and even one is far too many.

Moreover, capital punishment’s application is neither fair nor impartial. Systematic studies across continents have demonstrated alarming disparities in how the death penalty is applied—often along lines of race, socioeconomic status, or geography. In the United States, for example, racial minorities and the poor are disproportionately represented on death row. The implementation of capital punishment thus perpetuates inequalities, rewarding privilege while punishing the marginalized.

Now, let us address the question of deterrence. While proponents maintain that the threat of execution prevents heinous crimes, empirical evidence paints a drastically different picture. Study after study—conducted by leading criminologists and social scientists—have found no conclusive proof that capital punishment is more effective at deterring crime than life imprisonment. Countries that have abolished the death penalty have not seen spikes in violent crime; some have even recorded declines. In fact, the certainty of being caught and prosecuted is a far greater deterrent than the severity of the punishment.

Costs, too, must be considered. Contrary to popular belief, the process of capital litigation is vastly more expensive than sentencing someone to life without parole. The appeals, legal battles, and heightened protections necessary to even attempt to prevent miscarriages of justice come at enormous financial burden to the state—resources that could be directed toward victim support, crime prevention, rehabilitation, and community programs that address the root causes of crime.

Finally, the evolution of modern justice leans increasingly towards restoration, not retribution. True justice seeks to heal and rehabilitate, to address the factors leading to crime, not to perpetuate the cycle of violence."
bc587540-2cc8-4935-bcb1-c3b1868582c7,We should abolish capital punishment,gpt-4.1,"Honourable adjudicators, esteemed opponents, and members of the audience,

Today, I stand before you to unequivocally affirm the motion: We should abolish capital punishment.

Capital punishment—the state-sanctioned execution of a person as punishment for a crime—has long been a topic of moral, legal, and practical controversy. In this opening speech, I will present a compelling case highlighting the fundamental flaws, ethical inconsistencies, and practical failures that demand the abolition of the death penalty.

First and foremost, capital punishment is irrevocable and prone to egregious error. The justice system, no matter how rigorous and careful, is ultimately a human institution—subject to the fallibility, bias, and imperfection that define all human endeavors. There have been countless documented cases where individuals were wrongfully convicted of capital crimes, sometimes decades after their executions. The Innocence Project alone has exonerated hundreds of prisoners in the United States, many of whom were on death row, thanks to advances in DNA technology and the vigorous re-examination of evidence. Each of these cases is not just a statistic, but a testament to the unreliability of capital sentencing. When an innocent life is extinguished by the state, the injustice is absolute and irreversible—a miscarriage that no apology or compensation can ever mend.

Second, the death penalty does not achieve its purported goal—the deterrence of crime. Numerous empirical studies across different nations and states reveal no credible evidence that capital punishment deters homicide or other serious crimes more effectively than long-term imprisonment. For example, from 1990 to the present, U.S states without the death penalty have consistently exhibited lower murder rates than those retaining it. If the ultimate punishment does not serve as a superior deterrent, the rationale for its continued existence evaporates.

Third, capital punishment is not dispensed evenly, but is deeply tainted by social, economic, and racial prejudices. Marginalized individuals—those who are poor, poorly represented, or belong to minority communities—are disproportionately sentenced to death. Studies have shown that the race of the victim and the accused exerts a powerful influence over who receives a death sentence. This bias not only undermines the basic principles of justice and equality before the law, but it entrenches systemic discrimination within our courts and our society.

Fourth, advocates of capital punishment argue that it delivers justice and closure to the victims’ families. However, countless families have testified that the long, grueling appeals process and the highly publicized nature of capital cases only prolong their pain. In contrast, life imprisonment without parole delivers certainty, finality, and protection without the spectacle of state-sanctioned death.

Fifth, the existence of the death penalty erodes the moral authority of the state. By executing offenders, the state perpetuates the very cycle of violence it seeks to condemn. We send a flawed message: that killing is a legitimate response to killing, that retribution eclipses redemption. If society values life and upholds human rights as universal and inviolable, then we must reject vengeance as justice, no matter how heinous the crime.

Finally, abolishing capital punishment aligns with global progress. Over two-thirds of nations worldwide have abandoned the death penalty or ceased its execution, recognizing that true justice must be humane, fair, and responsible. We must not lag behind but lead with compassion and wisdom.

In conclusion, the death penalty is irreparably flawed: subject to error, ineffective as deterrence, unequally applied, traumatizing for victims’ families, corrosive to our values, and out of step with global standards. For all these reasons, we must abolish capital punishment. Let us affirm life, justice, and our shared humanity. Thank you."
90bd159f-d92d-4b01-b2ea-0c70ce3f7a8f,We should abolish foster care,gpt-4.1,"Honorable judges, esteemed opponents, and valued audience, today I stand in affirmation of the motion: We should abolish foster care.

At first glance, this may seem a radical proposal. Yet, it is necessary, urgent, and, most importantly, compassionate. Foster care, as we know it, was designed to offer safety and hope to children in crisis. But over decades, it has become a system that fails in its fundamental mission, systematically harming the very children it claims to protect. It is neither reformable nor just; therefore, abolition is not just bold—it is indispensable.

Let’s begin by confronting the hard truth: foster care perpetuates trauma and instability. When children are placed in foster homes, often after experiencing abuse, neglect, or family dysfunction, they require security and continuity. Instead, they are thrust into a bureaucratic labyrinth. According to federal data, over 30% of foster children experience three or more placements, each move compounding their trauma and uprooting precious bonds. How can we defend a system that drags vulnerable children through a carousel of strangers, schools, and neighborhoods—never offering the permanence they so desperately need?

Some may argue these children are safer in foster care than at home. Yet, the statistics tell a different story. Studies have found that children in foster care are, in some cases, more likely than their peers to experience abuse, both physical and sexual, while in state care. They suffer substantially higher rates of PTSD, substance abuse, and suicide. Up to 80% suffer from mental health issues, and within a few years of aging out, one in five will be homeless. These are not isolated failures—they are endemic.

But the failures of foster care are not just about outcomes; they are about design. It is a system rooted in forced separation. Instead of addressing the root causes that bring families into crisis—poverty, addiction, systemic racism—the foster system removes children, disproportionately targeting communities of color and the poor. Black children are nearly twice as likely as white children to enter foster care. This is not protection—it is perpetuation of inequality under the guise of child welfare.

To those who call for reform, I ask: How many decades and how many shattered lives must we accept before we acknowledge the fundamental flaw? Billions are spent annually on maintaining this broken infrastructure, but tinkering at the edges has not and will not solve the problem. “Better training” or “more oversight” cannot change the underlying reality: taking children from their families and placing them in transitory, often unvetted environments is inherently destabilizing, traumatic, and, for many, deeply damaging.

Abolition is not abdication. It is a demand to channel our resources, ingenuity, and compassion toward true solutions. Imagine a system where, instead of funneling funds into bureaucracy and temporary placements, we invest in robust, community-based support for families in crisis. Proven interventions—such as family preservation programs, kinship care, and wraparound services—strengthen families rather than destroy them. In the rare cases where removal is absolutely necessary, temporary guardianship with close relatives or community members, under continuous support, provides continuity, culture, and care. These models already exist and outperform foster care in both outcomes and child wellbeing.

Let’s be clear: abolishing foster care means ending a system that is failing and replacing it with one that actually serves children. This is a moral imperative. It is time to stop defending the indefensible. It is time to listen to the thousands of survivors who cry out for change. And it is time, finally, to create a humane, just, and effective system of care."
c73a71d7-5459-4d54-ae7e-94180221120b,We should abolish foster care,gpt-4.1,"Honorable judges, esteemed opponents, and respected audience,

Today, we confront a topic of profound moral, social, and humanitarian importance: “We should abolish foster care.” At first glance, this may seem radical, perhaps even unthinkable. Yet, when we look beyond intentions to real-world outcomes, it becomes clear—the foster care system, as it currently exists, perpetuates cycles of trauma, neglect, instability, and systemic failure. If our ultimate goal is the protection and flourishing of vulnerable children, we must summon the courage to abolish foster care and pursue transformative alternatives.

Let us start by understanding what foster care is supposed to do. Conceived as a safe haven for children whose biological families cannot care for them, foster care’s mission is to provide stability, love, and the foundation for a productive future. Yet, decades of evidence reveal that the system accomplishes the opposite: it removes children from their homes, places them with strangers, and exposes them to new harms, all while fracturing their sense of family and identity.

First, the psychological harm. Study after study demonstrates that children who pass through foster care are far more likely to suffer adverse mental health outcomes than their peers. According to a 2021 report by the American Academy of Pediatrics, over 80% of children enter foster care already burdened by significant trauma. Yet, instead of healing, they enter a system where further stress, uncertainty, and repeated placements—on average, a child moves homes over seven times—strip away any remaining sense of security. How can we justify a system where instability and isolation are the norm?

Secondly, let us consider the dismal outcomes foster care produces. Children aging out of the system are disproportionately likely to experience homelessness, unemployment, incarceration, and mental illness. According to the National Foster Youth Institute, nearly 1 in 5 foster youth become homeless after age 18, and 70% of incarcerated people in the U.S. have spent time in foster care. These statistics are not outliers; they are the rule. Foster care is not a springboard to success but a pipeline to hardship.

Moreover, the system grossly fails at protecting children from further abuse. Foster placements can be rife with neglect, exploitation, and even violence. Numerous investigations—such as the 2022 Associated Press exposé—have uncovered rampant sexual abuse and maltreatment in foster homes and residential facilities. The failures are not exceptions; they are endemic to a system that prioritizes case quotas over human lives.

Supporters of foster care might argue it is a necessary evil—the least bad option available. But it is a false choice. Around the world, cutting-edge models rooted in community care and family preservation have proved far more effective. In several European countries, robust social safety nets, in-home support, and kinship care keep children safely with relatives or within their communities, prioritizing reunification and healing over removal and punishment. These approaches drastically reduce both out-of-home placements and subsequent trauma.

What would abolition mean? Abolition does not mean abandonment. To abolish foster care is to redirect resources from maintaining a bureaucratic, punitive system to building holistic, innovative supports: intensive family preservation programs, wraparound services, and community-centered interventions proven to keep children safe and connected to their identities. Imagine investing our billions not in endless placements but in housing, mental health, and poverty relief for families in crisis.

In conclusion, the time has come to move from temporary fixes to meaningful change. The foster care system, despite its noble intentions, has irreparably failed the children it claims to protect."
54eed39e-d057-4d09-95e8-14b363cfc515,Community service should be mandatory,gpt-4.1,"Honorable judges, respected opponents, and esteemed audience,

Today, we debate the motion: “Community service should be mandatory.” We, on the proposition, firmly support this statement—not merely as an ideal, but as a pragmatic and transformative policy that has the potential to build better individuals, stronger communities, and a healthier, more equitable society.

Let us begin by considering the core function of community service. It is, fundamentally, a means by which individuals contribute to the common good. From supporting the elderly, rejuvenating public spaces, tutoring disadvantaged youth, to environmental clean-ups, community service bridges gaps and addresses needs that may otherwise go unmet. Yet, in many societies, participation is limited, often dependent on individual motivation or social privilege. As a result, much of the potential positive impact remains unfulfilled.

Making community service mandatory corrects this imbalance. Firstly, it ensures that the burden—and the opportunity—of serving society is equally shared. It recognizes that the benefits we all derive from living in a community demand a reciprocal contribution from each of us. If we embrace the rights inherent in citizenship, must we not also accept its responsibilities?

Mandatory community service is an investment in civic education and social responsibility. We do not hesitate to require schooling or jury duty, recognizing that these mandatory activities are foundational to a functioning democracy. Community service offers something similar—an education in empathy, collaboration, and practical societal engagement. Through service, individuals directly witness the challenges faced by others, broadening their perspectives and nurturing compassion. They learn that society does not thrive when only a few contribute, but when all hands are on deck.

Consider the widespread problem of civic disengagement. In recent years, we have seen declining participation in voting, volunteering, and grassroots initiatives. Demanding at least a basic level of community service from all citizens—especially youth—instills habits of engagement and responsibility that last a lifetime. Studies reveal that those who serve their communities at a young age are more likely to be active, socially conscious citizens as adults.

Moreover, mandatory service helps break down societal barriers. Communities are all too often divided by lines of class, race, or geography. A program that brings together individuals from diverse backgrounds to work towards a common goal fosters understanding and unity. In the shared pursuit of service, stereotypes are challenged, prejudice is diminished, and solidarity is built. Imagine the power of a society where service is not the exception, but the rule.

The tangible benefits to communities are also immense. Many non-profit organizations and public services operate chronically understaffed, limiting their reach and effectiveness. Mandatory community service provides a reliable source of helping hands, enabling these organizations to expand programs and reach those most in need. This is not just charity—it is the scaffolding that supports social progress and resilience.

Some critics argue that mandating service diminishes its value, transforming a voluntary act of kindness into a compulsory task. On the contrary, we contend that service’s value is inherent not only in personal motivation but in collective action. Consider recycling laws or compulsory education—they have benefitted society precisely because everyone participates, not just the motivated few.

Of course, implementation would require thoughtful planning: flexibility in service options, accommodations for those with special needs, and recognition of service tailored to individual capabilities. But these are logistical challenges, not insurmountable barriers.

In sum, making community service mandatory is about weaving social responsibility into the very fabric of citizenship. It is a policy that invests in empathy, strengthens communities, and prepares future generations for the challenges of our interconnected world."
21042052-a68d-4680-8fd5-b817ccedad2e,Community service should be mandatory,gpt-4.1,"Ladies and gentlemen, esteemed judges, respected opponents, and valued audience—today we stand before you to champion a principle that has the power to ignite civic pride, foster empathy, and unify our society: the mandatory participation in community service.

At first, the phrase ""mandatory community service"" may sound controversial. Some may object, arguing that service should arise from the goodness of one's heart, not be compelled by law or policy. But let us take a closer look at the myriad benefits—for individuals and for society—when everyone commits just a fraction of their time to serve their community.

To begin, let us address the most pressing issue facing our societies today: disconnection. In an increasingly digital and fast-paced world, communities are growing more fragmented. Trust declines, empathy wanes, and civic responsibility is often lost in the shuffle. Mandatory community service is the antidote. It bridges divides by pushing people beyond their social bubbles and exposing them to neighbors with different backgrounds, beliefs, and struggles. It forges connections and fosters understanding, laying the groundwork for strong, resilient societies.

Empirical evidence demonstrates the power of service. Take, for instance, nations like Germany and Israel, where youth participate in mandated ""social years,"" and benefit from greater civic engagement, reduced prejudice, and stronger democratic values. Studies from the Corporation for National and Community Service in the United States reveal that individuals who serve their communities as youth are more likely to vote, volunteer in the future, and stay out of trouble. When we serve, we are not only changing the world around us—we are changing ourselves for the better.

Secondly, mandatory community service isn’t merely a charitable gesture; it’s an investment in human capital. It cultivates invaluable life skills—teamwork, communication, problem-solving, adaptability. Whether cleaning a park, mentoring a younger student, or organizing food drives, individuals develop abilities that employers crave and that our economies desperately need. In a competitive global marketplace, shouldn’t we ensure all citizens—regardless of background—develop these foundational skills?

Moreover, community service acts as a great social equalizer. It can level the playing field for those who are disadvantaged. Imagine schools where every student, regardless of socioeconomic status, gains hands-on experience in leadership and organization. Imagine communities where every citizen, young or old, rich or poor, comes together to confront shared challenges. When service is reserved for volunteers, only the privileged can truly afford to participate. When it is made mandatory, society as a whole benefits, as every voice, every hand, every talent is included in building a better future.

Furthermore, let us not neglect the moral imperative. We owe something to the communities that raise us—the schools, roads, parks, and services that function only because previous generations invested their energy. Mandatory service is an expression of gratitude and responsibility. It teaches humility and gratitude while fostering the next generation of community leaders.

Now, some may worry that compulsion negates the spirit of service. Yet history, from compulsory education to mandatory jury duty, is filled with examples of how individual obligations are necessary to sustain a thriving democracy. Through collective effort and shared sacrifice, we build a more just society.

In conclusion, making community service mandatory is not about infringing on personal freedom. It is about nurturing civic habits, building stronger communities, and equipping individuals with critical skills. It reconnects us with the fabric of society and ensures that everyone—not just the willing few—shares in the responsibility to sustain and strengthen the world we inhabit."
8da701b3-febe-4159-a48d-128424d4e788,We should further exploit sustainable energies,gpt-4.1,"Honourable judges, respected opponents, and esteemed audience,

Today, we stand at a crucial crossroad in human history—one shaped by innovation, progress, and above all, pressing responsibility. The challenge before us is clear: are we, as a global community, ready to seize the promise of sustainable energy, or will we continue to rely on methods of producing power that exhaust our planet’s finite resources and endanger our collective future? I stand firmly in support of the motion that we should further exploit sustainable energies, and I invite you to join me as I lay out the compelling reasons why embracing this course is not simply an option—it is an imperative.

First and foremost, sustainable energies—solar, wind, hydro, geothermal, and biomass—offer an inexhaustible supply of energy. Unlike fossil fuels, which are limited and depleting rapidly, these sources are naturally replenished on a human timescale. The sun shines, the wind blows, and rivers flow whether we harness their power or not. By further exploiting sustainable energies, we step away from the perpetual risk of scarcity, price volatility, and energy insecurity. Embracing renewables ensures stable energy supplies for future generations and shields societies from the geopolitical tensions and conflicts so often sparked by competition over fossil fuel reserves.

Secondly, exploiting sustainable energies is an urgent necessity for environmental protection and climate resilience. Energy production from coal, oil, and gas is the largest source of greenhouse gases driving climate change. According to the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, to avoid the most catastrophic effects of climate change, we must halve emissions by 2030 and achieve net-zero by mid-century. This will not be possible if we remain shackled to unsustainable energy sources. By expanding our use of renewables, we immediately cut carbon pollution, reduce air and water contamination, and stave off the worst impacts of a warming planet—deadly heatwaves, rising sea levels, and catastrophic storms. In fact, the International Energy Agency has confirmed that scaling up sustainable energy is the single most effective lever we have to mitigate climate change.

Moreover, there is a compelling economic argument for further exploitation of sustainable energies. The myth that renewables are prohibitively expensive is now outdated. Over the past decade, the cost of solar and wind energy has plummeted. In many regions, these are now the cheapest sources of new power generation—often less costly even than coal or natural gas. According to BloombergNEF, 90% of the world’s population now lives in countries where renewables are the lowest-cost energy option. Exploiting these resources creates millions of high-quality jobs, stimulates investment in new technologies, and opens doors for innovation and entrepreneurship. It boosts local economies, reduces dependence on volatile global markets, and empowers communities to control their own energy destinies.

Social benefits also abound. Fossil fuel pollution leads to nearly nine million premature deaths every year—a staggering toll that disproportionately harms children, the elderly, and vulnerable populations. Transitioning to clean energy means cleaner air, healthier lives, and significant savings in health costs. It means energy access for all: in many developing regions, exploiting local solar or wind potential can bring power to remote communities for the first time, supporting education, healthcare, and economic development.

Some may argue that reliance on renewable energy brings technical challenges—intermittency, integration, and storage. But these are challenges we are rapidly overcoming through innovation in battery technologies, smart grids, and diversified energy portfolios. The pace of progress is extraordinary, and every day brings fresh breakthroughs that make the promise of a sustainable energy future even more certain."
74b5f37d-4ae5-4ed7-ba99-b734efe78758,We should further exploit sustainable energies,gpt-4.1,"Honorable judges, esteemed opponents, respected timekeeper, and distinguished audience,

Today, we gather to debate a topic of paramount importance—not only for our present generation, but for countless generations that will follow. The motion before us is clear: We should further exploit sustainable energies.

I rise in firm affirmation of this proposition for three compelling reasons: the undeniable necessity to address climate change, the unrivaled economic opportunities presented by sustainable energy, and the advancement of energy security and social equity worldwide.

First, let us confront an uncomfortable truth—the Earth is in crisis. Our dependency on fossil fuels has led us to the brink of environmental catastrophe. The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, comprised of world-leading scientists, has confirmed that to avoid the worst impacts of climate change, global greenhouse gas emissions must be halved by 2030 and reach net-zero by 2050. Sustainable energies—wind, solar, hydroelectric, geothermal, and tidal power—are the most direct and effective tools we possess to achieve this. Unlike fossil fuels, they do not emit harmful greenhouse gases or toxic pollutants. Transitioning to sustainable energy is not a luxury; it is a necessity, a moral and practical imperative to preserve the planet we inhabit.

Some might argue that sustainable energies alone are insufficient and intermittent, citing cloudy days or calm winds as insurmountable challenges. However, advancements in battery storage, smart grids, and diversified renewables debunk this myth. Look at Denmark, which now generates over 50% of its electricity from wind. Or consider Costa Rica, which regularly runs on 99% renewable energy. The evidence is clear: countries that seize sustainable energy lead not only in environmental stewardship but also in technological innovation.

Second, let us consider the economic logic. Sustainable energies are no longer expensive novelties—they are, in many cases, the cheapest source of new energy generation available. The International Renewable Energy Agency reports that renewables became the world’s cheapest source of power in 2020, costing less than coal and natural gas in most regions. Investing in sustainable energies drives massive job creation; the sector already employs over 12 million people globally, with millions more jobs on the horizon. Compare this to the decline of the fossil fuel industry, where automation and divestment are causing job losses.

Further exploiting sustainable energies stimulates local economies, reduces energy import bills, and insulates our society from volatile global oil prices. Every dollar we invest in sustainable energy brings a return not only in clean power, but in public health, economic resilience, and future-proof careers. It is both a moral and an economic imperative.

Finally, energy is not just a technical issue—it is human. Over 700 million people worldwide still lack access to reliable electricity, trapping them in poverty and limiting their ability to learn, work, or access healthcare. Fossil fuels perpetuate this inequity, tying energy to geography and politics. By harnessing abundant sunlight in Africa, wind in Europe, and geothermal power in Asia, sustainable energies empower communities everywhere. Distributed energy can leapfrog old, centralized power grids and be tailored to local needs, democratizing electricity and fostering independence.

Expanding sustainable energies also means reducing international conflict driven by competition for scarce resources. By relying on the infinite resources of sun, wind, and water, we lessen tensions and create a foundation for peace and cooperation.

Honorable judges, let us be clear: further exploiting sustainable energies is not merely about changing how we power our homes or our industries. It is about choosing a future—not just for ourselves, but for our children and theirs after them. It is a path toward environmental survival, economic prosperity, and social justice."
1945a0e5-fdf5-4d8e-b24d-d0853bb0bf4d,We should ban cosmetic surgery,gpt-4.1,"Ladies and gentlemen, honorable judges, esteemed opponents, and valued audience members,

Today, we gather to deliberate a matter of utmost significance—a topic that strikes at the core of our society’s values, health, and well-being. The motion before us is clear: ""We should ban cosmetic surgery."" I stand in strong affirmation of this motion, ready to present the compelling reasons why such a ban is not only logical, but necessary for the betterment of individuals and society at large.

To begin, let us clarify the parameters. Cosmetic surgery, by definition, refers to surgical procedures intended solely to enhance one's appearance, with no medical necessity underlying the intervention. This stands in contrast to reconstructive surgery, which seeks to restore function or normal appearance after injury, illness, or congenital defects. Our debate centers on elective, aesthetic procedures—such as rhinoplasty for appearance, breast augmentation, liposuction for body sculpting, and facelifts—those acts pursued to conform to subjective ideals of beauty.

The first and most persuasive argument for banning cosmetic surgery lies in the grave risks it poses to physical and psychological well-being. All surgical procedures carry inherent risks—bleeding, infection, anesthesia complications, blood clots, scarring. Yet, cosmetic procedures are often performed in private clinics, not robust hospitals; practitioners prioritize aesthetics over medical necessity, and regulations can be alarmingly lax. Studies show complications ranging from disfigurement to paralysis, and even death. Consider the tragic stories splashed across headlines, of lives lost or permanently damaged in pursuit of unattainable perfection. Is it ethical, I ask, to allow individuals to expose themselves to such risks when there is no overriding medical necessity?

Moreover, cosmetic surgery not only jeopardizes physical health but also undermines mental and emotional well-being. It cultivates and preys upon insecurity, embedding the dangerous notion that our natural appearance is inadequate. It breeds body dysmorphia, fuels low self-esteem, and often fails to deliver the psychological satisfaction it promises. In fact, many who undergo surgery seek further alterations, entering a vicious cycle of dissatisfaction and repeated interventions. Far from empowering people, cosmetic surgery reinforces the unending chase for an illusory ideal, perpetuated by a profit-driven industry.

Secondly, by enabling cosmetic surgery, society implicitly endorses unrealistic and narrow beauty standards, laying a foundation for widespread social harm. The prevalence of cosmetic procedures amplifies the pressure to conform, especially among young people. Social media and advertising relentlessly showcase surgically enhanced, often artificially altered, bodies and faces as the ideal. The consequences are devastating: lost self-confidence, eating disorders, depression, and anxiety epidemics. If we ban cosmetic surgery, we send a powerful message rejecting the tyranny of superficiality, and embrace the diversity of natural beauty. We encourage acceptance and resilience, rather than conformity at any cost.

Furthermore, cosmetic surgery entangles complex ethical and moral questions. It is frequently driven by external coercion—whether subtle, through societal expectations, or overt, through partners or employers. Consent, in such contexts, becomes dubious. Are people truly exercising free will, or are they responding to manipulative pressures and opportunistic marketing? The line between empowerment and exploitation blurs dangerously.

Finally, let us consider the allocation of healthcare resources. In a world where millions lack access to basic, essential healthcare, it is indefensible to divert skilled surgeons, operating theaters, anesthesia, and post-operative care toward procedures that serve no health need. By banning cosmetic surgery, we can better utilize medical expertise and infrastructure to treat disease, injury, and suffering that genuinely require intervention.

In conclusion, cosmetic surgery—when divorced from medical necessity—endangers health, erodes self-worth, distorts societal values, and siphons resources away from true healing."
09157dae-9111-455a-8b4d-a80cb0229de3,We should ban cosmetic surgery,gpt-4.1,"Ladies and gentlemen, esteemed judges, honorable opponents, and valued audience,

Today, we stand at a critical juncture—a crossroads where ethics, health, and the very fabric of our society converge. The motion before us is not just about individual choice; it is about the broader consequences of our collective actions. The topic at hand: ""We should ban cosmetic surgery."" I stand in resolute support of this motion—not out of a desire to curtail personal freedoms, but out of the imperative to protect public health, ensure mental well-being, dismantle harmful societal pressures, and defend the norms that knit our communities together.

First, let us consider the inherent risks and dangers associated with cosmetic surgery. By its very definition, cosmetic surgery is a medically unnecessary intervention, performed not to correct illness or injury, but to alter appearance in the pursuit of subjective ideals. These procedures carry all the risks of any major surgery: complications from anesthesia, infections, excessive bleeding, nerve damage, and even death. The British Association of Aesthetic Plastic Surgeons reports that nearly 1 in 10 patients suffer complications requiring further medical intervention. Unlike surgeries justified by medical need, cosmetic surgery exposes individuals to harm without necessity. Is it justifiable, as a society, to normalize and permit avoidable risk-taking on such a massive scale?

Secondly, we must address the profound mental health ramifications. It is well-documented that those who undergo cosmetic surgery are more likely to suffer from body dysmorphic disorder, depression, and anxiety, both before and after their procedures. The hope is that altering one's appearance will cure insecurities, but for far too many, it only deepens the cycle of self-criticism and dissatisfaction. Cosmetic surgery is not a panacea for psychological distress—in many cases, it aggravates the underlying issues, while reinforcing the toxic belief that worth is measured by appearance. By banning cosmetic surgery, we redirect attention to treating the root causes of low self-esteem and mental distress, rather than offering an illusory quick fix.

Thirdly, we cannot ignore the corrosive impact of cosmetic surgery on social justice and equality. By making drastic physical change accessible—usually only to those with financial privilege—we reinforce a narrow, commercialized standard of beauty. This fosters a culture where natural diversity is devalued, fueling discrimination, body shaming, and exclusion. For the young and vulnerable, this is particularly perilous. Studies show a dramatic rise in teenagers seeking or aspiring to cosmetic procedures, victims of a media landscape saturated with unrealistic, altered images. Cosmetic surgery does not promote acceptance—it enshrines an arbitrary, one-size-fits-all vision of attractiveness, intensifying inequality and eroding collective self-acceptance.

Some might argue that personal autonomy should prevail—that adults have the right to modify their own bodies as they wish. Yet, it is precisely because autonomy must be meaningful and informed that banning cosmetic surgery is justified. The omnipresent pressure to look ""perfect"" creates what psychologists call ""manufactured consent""—choices made in a context of coercion, not true freedom. Where societal expectations are so powerful that they override self-acceptance, consent itself is corrupted. Legal bans exist for similar reasons in other domains—think of restrictions on dangerous drugs or exploitative labor. When the common good and individual health are at risk, society has a duty to intervene.

Ladies and gentlemen, cosmetic surgery is not an individual whim—it is a social phenomenon with profound consequences. It perpetuates harm, deepens inequalities, and commodifies human bodies at the expense of health and dignity. The time has come to say, unequivocally, that our values as a society must be rooted in acceptance, compassion, and the protection of authentic individuality."
98db2d77-e21f-4a7d-bfc5-ac4e7e3c0ee6,We should lower the age of consent,gpt-4.1,"Ladies and gentlemen, honorable judges, and esteemed opponents,

Thank you for the opportunity to present our case in support of lowering the age of consent. It is a topic fraught with emotion and misunderstanding, yet at its core, it demands a thoughtful, rational, and compassionate examination of the realities young people face today.

First, let me clarify our position. We do not advocate recklessness nor the undermining of protections for youth. Rather, we argue for a re-examination of age of consent laws that are often outdated, inconsistent, and out of step with social and scientific realities. We believe that a carefully considered reduction in the age of consent, accompanied by robust education and support systems, offers greater protection, empowerment, and justice for young people.

Let us begin with the principle of autonomy. Autonomy refers to the individual’s right to make informed decisions about their own bodies and relationships. In many societies, teenagers are entrusted with significant responsibilities before reaching the legal age of consent. They can work, consent to medical treatments, be held criminally responsible, or even—as young as 16 in some places—join the armed forces. To argue that teenagers are capable of these serious decisions but wholly incapable of making informed choices about their consensual relationships is inconsistent and paternalistic. Respecting the autonomy of young people means recognizing their capacity for agency and providing them with tools and protections rather than blanket prohibitions.

Second, let us consider public health and safety. Too often, age of consent laws drive youthful sexual activity underground, shrouded in secrecy and shame, rather than fostering open dialogue and responsible behavior. When teenagers fear criminal repercussions for consensual activity, they are less likely to seek information about contraception, consent, or healthy relationships. This can lead to unintended pregnancies, transmission of sexually transmitted infections, and perpetuation of harmful myths. Furthermore, these laws can be, and have been, wielded punitively—persecuting young people for consensual acts with peers, destroying futures, particularly among marginalized or LGBTQ+ youth. Lowering the age of consent, when paired with comprehensive sex education, invites honesty and empowers youth to make safer, more informed choices.

Third, let us acknowledge the legal inconsistencies and injustices created by current age of consent laws. Across the world, and even within countries, the legal age of consent varies widely—from 14 to 18 and beyond—often for reasons rooted in history or politics rather than science or child welfare. These inconsistencies can result in arbitrary prosecution and disparate impacts on minority groups, as well as confusion for young people themselves. Adopting a rational, evidence-based approach to the age of consent, standardizing it at a lower but reasonable age, and including close-in-age exemptions, would reduce confusion and promote fairness.

Moreover, there is a crucial distinction between consensual relationships between peers and exploitative relationships with adults. Lowering the age of consent does not mean erasing protections against predatory behavior. Laws can and must be structured to harshly penalize coercion, abuse of power, and age-disparate exploitation. Our proposal is not about removing protection, but rather about ensuring that legal frameworks target actual harm, not consensual acts between teenagers.

Finally, let us listen to the voices of young people themselves. Advances in neuroscience and psychology show that while adolescence is a time of growth and learning, young people possess the cognitive ability—especially with support and education—to understand and consent to relationships. Denying their voices fosters mistrust, disengagement, and, paradoxically, greater vulnerability."
39f98aea-cf37-43eb-ac8c-f34ee14907fa,We should lower the age of consent,gpt-4.1,"Ladies and gentlemen, esteemed judges, and honorable opponents,

Today we gather to debate a sensitive yet vital issue: Whether we should lower the age of consent. This topic demands a thoughtful, nuanced approach, and I stand before you to argue decisively in favor of lowering the age of consent.

The age of consent laws, as they exist today in many places, are relics of another era, often rooted in outdated moral beliefs rather than empirical evidence or consideration for the real lives of young people. Modern research, legal precedent, and the lived experiences of adolescents themselves all point toward the urgent need for reform. I will advance this argument along three main lines: the importance of recognizing adolescent autonomy, the potential for better protection of young people, and the alignment of legal standards with social realities.

First, let us address the question of adolescent autonomy. Adolescence is widely recognized as a period of burgeoning independence and self-determination. Modern neuroscience and psychology affirm that young people develop agency, critical thinking, and emotional intelligence far earlier than the law often admits. Many countries already grant significant rights and responsibilities to teenagers—whether it is the right to work, to drive, to access contraception, or to be held criminally responsible for their actions—often at ages lower than the prevailing age of consent. To deny them agency over their own bodies and relationships is not only inconsistent but also an affront to their dignity.

Lowering the age of consent would better acknowledge the reality: teenagers are making choices about their intimate lives, regardless of the legal landscape. By labeling natural, consensual teenage behavior as criminal simply because of arbitrary age thresholds, we risk branding young people as offenders or victims when, in many cases, no harm has occurred. Such laws, far from protecting young people, can create shame and stigma, stifle honest conversations, and sometimes unjustly destroy lives with heavy legal consequences.

Second, lowering the age of consent—when done responsibly and accompanied by robust safeguards—can actually improve protection for young people. Critics often suggest that these laws shield minors from exploitation. While well-intentioned, the current regime sometimes fails in its aims. Overly broad laws can discourage teenagers from reporting abuse, for fear that they—and their consensual partners—could be prosecuted. A lower age of consent, paired with so-called ""close-in-age"" or ""Romeo and Juliet"" exemptions, allows the legal system to focus its resources and protection on genuine cases of abuse and coercion, particularly involving much older adults preying on minors.

Moreover, modern sex education and youth services are most effective when paired with legal structures that respect adolescents’ rights to seek help and advice without fear of criminal repercussions. Only then can we foster an environment in which young people are empowered to set boundaries, seek support, and develop into healthy adults.

Third, we must bring the law in line with social reality. Studies across the world attest that the onset of sexual activity in adolescence is not determined by legislation, but by developmental, social, and cultural factors. The law, as it stands, too often seeks to legislate away the facts of life, rather than supporting young people to navigate them safely. In countries where the age of consent is lower—such as Germany and the Netherlands—there is no evidence of higher rates of abuse. Instead, these societies often boast better sexual health outcomes, lower rates of teenage pregnancy, and broader youth wellbeing.

In conclusion, to lower the age of consent is not to abandon the protection of minors."
bae65a7f-60da-4d41-934d-f0bf4d64e4c3,We should ban organic food,gpt-4.1,"Honourable judges, respected opponents, esteemed audience—

Today, I stand before you to propose a motion that may at first seem provocative, but is, upon close scrutiny, necessary for the public good: that we should ban organic food.

Let me make our position clear. We do not say this out of disdain for nature or nostalgia for the past. Instead, we argue for a ban on organic food because, examined through the prisms of public health, environmental responsibility, global equity, and scientific accuracy, the consequences of allowing organic food to flourish are not merely questionable—they are outright harmful.

First and foremost, the organic food movement, while well-intentioned, creates dangerously misleading perceptions about food safety and nutrition. Organic marketing preys on consumer fears, suggesting that non-organic, conventionally grown foods are somehow toxic or inferior. In reality, the overwhelming scientific consensus—based on hundreds of independent studies—shows that there is no meaningful difference in the nutritional content of organic versus conventional foods. The perpetuation of the myth of “superior” organic nutrition undermines trust in science, fosters unnecessary anxiety, and glamorizes a lifestyle accessible mainly to the affluent.

Worse still, organic farming is, paradoxically, less environmentally friendly than its conventional counterpart. Organic farming bans the use of synthetic fertilizers and pesticides, but substitutes them with “natural” alternatives that are often less effective, more toxic in their raw form, and require greater quantities to achieve similar results. Most seriously, organic yields are on average 20–25% lower than conventional crops per hectare. Because organic farming is less efficient, it requires substantially more land to produce the same amount of food.

What does this inefficiency mean in practice? More land converted from forests to crops. Greater strain on biodiversity. Increased water usage. And a reversal of decarbonisation gains: the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change and other environmental authorities have warned that a widespread switch to organic farming would dramatically increase humanity’s carbon footprint and exacerbate global food insecurity.

Speaking of insecurity: the organic food movement deepens socio-economic divisions. Organic products, by nature of their inefficiency and boutique branding, are dramatically more expensive than conventional alternatives. What message does it send that a small minority can afford to “opt out” of the mainstream food system, touting their purchases as morally superior, while the vast majority—especially in developing nations—bear the brunt of increased prices and reduced food supply? Instead of moving forward to a world where technology and science enable food security for all, the organic trend promotes regress—romanticizing low-yield, less resilient techniques that cannot feed our growing planet.

Let us consider, too, the public health risks. Organic farming’s ban on synthetic pesticides is not based on their toxicity, but on their origin—synthetic versus natural. Yet many “natural” pesticides allowed in organic farming are demonstrably more harmful than modern, highly targeted, rigorously tested chemicals. To ban synthetic solutions ignores decades of safety research, and exposes consumers, farm workers, and the environment to greater risks.

Moreover, the existence of organic food misleads the public into thinking that conventional methods are dangerous, which undermines trust in food safety regulations developed by scientists and public health authorities. This stymies the adoption of life-saving innovations such as genetically modified organisms—crops that resist pests, use less pesticide, and survive harsher climates. In a world facing climate change and growing food demand, we cannot afford to shun the tools of progress.

In closing, organic food is a luxury ideology pretending to be a solution—a movement that underdelivers on nutrition, overburdens the environment, fuels inequality, and distracts from real innovation."
98eeeb9c-a5e6-4c05-b51d-80ee6afba883,We should ban organic food,gpt-4.1,"Ladies and gentlemen, esteemed judges, and respected opponents,

Imagine a world where every bite of food you consume is safe, environmentally responsible, and accessible to all. Today, we advocate for that vision—a vision that can only become reality if we make a difficult but necessary decision: to ban organic food.

At first glance, ""organic"" carries positive connotations—natural, pure, wholesome. Yet, as I will show, the organic food movement, while well-intentioned, ultimately causes more harm than good to public health, the environment, and our wider society. It is precisely because we care deeply about people, planet, and progress that we must be bold enough to call for a ban on organic food.

Let us first consider the issue of public health. Organic food is frequently marketed as being healthier, more nutritious, and safer than conventionally produced alternatives. However, extensive scientific studies show that there is no significant nutritional difference between organic and conventional foods. The British Journal of Nutrition and Stanford University meta-analyses, for example, reveal that the supposed health advantages of organics are, at best, negligible. Worse yet, by shunning conventional agriculture's proven methods, organic farmers forgo critical tools such as synthetic pesticides—tools that protect crops from dangerous contaminants like mold and fungi. The result? Organic produce is actually more susceptible to mycotoxins and foodborne pathogens. In fact, organic farming’s reliance on animal manure—often inadequately sterilized—increases the risk of E. coli contamination. Consider the 2011 E. coli outbreak in Germany, linked to organic sprouts, which claimed over 50 lives and sickened thousands. By continuing to promote and legitimize organic food, we expose consumers to unnecessary food safety risks.

The problem deepens when we turn to environmental impact. Supporters often claim that organic farming is more sustainable, but research tells a different story. Organic agriculture is, by its very nature, less efficient: it produces significantly lower yields—on average, 19–25% less—than conventional farming. To achieve the same output, more land must be cleared. This means more forests felled, more habitats destroyed, and greater loss of biodiversity. Organic farmers may eschew synthetic pesticides, but they use larger quantities of naturally derived ones, some of which are more toxic or require repeated applications. Even renowned ecologist Stewart Brand calls organic farming ""a catastrophic misdirection for the climate."" In a world where millions face food insecurity and climate change threatens us all, embracing a form of agriculture that wastes land and resources is not just misguided—it is immoral.

Furthermore, the organic food industry exacerbates inequality and misleads the public. Organic fare costs, on average, 47% more than conventional food, putting it out of reach for lower- and middle-income families. The “organic” label becomes a status symbol for the privileged—a misplaced signal of virtue that burdens struggling families with guilt or financial strain, all for negligible benefit. Worse yet, the organic industry capitalizes on fear-based marketing, demonizing conventional farmers and science-based solutions like GMOs and modern pesticides. This breeds suspicion, undermines trust in food security, and drives polarization at a time when we need cooperation and innovation to tackle hunger and climate change.

Proponents may say that banning organic food is draconian or a violation of consumer choice. But we must recognize that individual choices, when amplified by misinformation and market manipulation, can threaten collective wellbeing. We regulate countless products to ensure safety and sustainability: from banning lead paint to restricting tobacco sales. When a product’s widespread adoption does more harm than good—when it undermines scientific consensus, environmental stewardship, and social equality—regulation is not just justified; it is imperative."
65298235-7193-4109-917d-ac0fbe5484ef,We should ban abortions,gpt-4.1,"Ladies and gentlemen, esteemed judges, honorable opponents, and audience members: today I stand firmly in support of the motion—""We should ban abortions."" This is not a position I present lightly. Indeed, it grapples with one of the most challenging moral, ethical, and social debates of our time. But I believe that with careful consideration, we can see why a ban on abortion is not only justified, but necessary for the protection of our most basic human values.

First and foremost, let us consider the fundamental right to life. From the moment of conception, science tells us that a unique human being exists. The zygote is not merely a cluster of random cells; it contains a distinct DNA sequence—a blueprint for a wholly unique person. The heartbeat begins as early as six weeks, and development continues rapidly. If we believe in universal human rights, then surely the right to life must extend to the most vulnerable members of our species—unborn children. It is inconsistent and unjustifiable to afford protection and dignity to human life only after birth. Our laws recognize the sanctity of life in countless other situations—why should the womb be an exception?

Secondly, to ban abortion is to uphold the ethical principle that taking innocent life is wrong. We, as a society, collectively agree that murder, manslaughter, and violence are intolerable. When we allow abortion, we create a notable exception to this rule—one that allows the termination of life solely based on circumstance or convenience. This exception erodes the very foundation of moral consistency. If human value is to be respected, it cannot be contingent on location, age, or dependency. The unborn, precisely because they are powerless, deserve our greatest protection.

Some will argue that banning abortion restricts a woman’s autonomy. This is a serious concern, and it deserves our respect. But autonomy is not, and has never been, an absolute right. There are always limits where the rights of another begin. Just as one’s right to swing their fist ends at another’s nose, so too must bodily autonomy end when it risks fatal harm to another human. The conception of a child, while undoubtedly a momentous event for any woman, initiates a new life whose rights cannot be ignored. To insist on absolute autonomy in this matter is to disregard the humanity of the unborn.

Furthermore, banning abortion promotes a culture of life—a society that values human life at every stage. Societal attitudes are shaped by our laws. When abortion is legal, it sends the message that certain lives are disposable, that the worth of a human being is negotiable. When abortion is banned, we affirm that every human life is valuable, regardless of circumstances of conception or any perceived frailty. This will, in turn, encourage better solutions for women facing crisis pregnancies—more support systems, more resources for mothers and children, and a community that rallies behind both lives involved.

Finally, the availability of abortion as a solution distracts from addressing underlying issues. Many women are driven to seek abortions because of economic hardship, lack of support, or social stigma. A ban would force society to confront and remedy these root causes, rather than offer abortion as a heartbreaking 'quick fix.' Instead of ending lives, we should collectively work to end the conditions that make abortion seem necessary.

In conclusion, the case for banning abortions rests on core principles of human rights, moral consistency, societal values, and compassion towards both mother and child. A civilized society is measured by how it treats its most vulnerable."
9ef982ce-29ca-428b-a490-eaa7d843a80e,We should ban abortions,gpt-4.1,"Ladies and gentlemen, honorable judges, esteemed opponents, and respected audience members:

Today, I stand before you to defend the proposition that we should ban abortions. This is a subject that evokes profound emotions and heated debate, but at its core lies a fundamental question about our values as a society—about when life begins, about our responsibilities to the vulnerable, and about what kind of moral integrity we want to uphold.

Let me start by addressing the central issue: the right to life. The most fundamental human right, without which all other rights are meaningless, is the right to life itself. Science is clear that from the moment of conception, a unique human organism comes into existence. This new being has its own DNA, its own trajectory of development, and, left undisturbed, will grow into a fully realized person. If we, as a society, accept the deliberate termination of innocent human life at its earliest stages, we are abandoning the most basic moral tenet that underpins any civilization—the protection of the vulnerable.

Opponents may argue that a fetus is not a person, but even if we entertain doubts about the precise moment personhood begins, should we not err on the side of caution? Should we not give the benefit of the doubt to the entity with no voice or power to defend itself? Throughout history, whenever societies have erred in defining who counts as human, oppression and injustice have followed: whether it was the denial of rights based on skin color, gender, or nationality. Today, the unborn are denied their basic rights simply because of their stage of development. This is not compassion; it is exclusion of the most defenseless.

Beyond the ethical argument, there are social consequences to consider. Widespread access to abortion fosters a culture in which life is treated as disposable. It erodes our collective sense of responsibility—toward our children, toward unborn lives, and toward our future society. When abortion is treated as a routine solution to the challenges of unplanned pregnancy, it sends a message that human life is only valuable when it is wanted or convenient. This mindset devalues not only the unborn, but also those who are vulnerable in other ways—the disabled, the elderly, and the marginalized.

We must also consider the long-term psychological and emotional impact on women. Numerous studies have documented that abortion can lead to depression, anxiety, and even post-traumatic stress. Rather than empowering women, abortion often leaves them bearing invisible scars. In contrast, choosing life—even in the face of hardship—can be an act of profound courage and strength. When we ban abortion, we are challenging our society to provide real solutions: comprehensive support for mothers, better access to healthcare, adoption avenues that honor both mother and child, and communities that rally around those facing unplanned pregnancies. Banning abortion is not about punishing women; it is about respecting life and building a society that supports every member from their very first moments.

Some may raise the issue of exceptional cases—rape, incest, or danger to the mother’s health. Let me be clear: every tragic situation deserves compassion and robust support. But rare and heartbreaking circumstances should not dictate laws that affect the vast majority of abortions, which are performed for non-medical, often socioeconomic reasons. With medical advancement and strong social safety nets, we can address the needs of women facing difficulties without compromising the fundamental right to life of the unborn.

In conclusion, it is our duty as a civilization to protect those who cannot protect themselves."
ff288dcd-a9bb-457a-8e43-d25caf381593,Organ donation should be mandatory,gpt-4.1,"Ladies and gentlemen, esteemed judges, honorable opponents, and members of the audience,

Today we are gathered to debate an issue that strikes at the very core of our values as a society – our commitment to life, compassion, and the collective good. The motion before us is clear: Organ donation should be mandatory. On behalf of the proposition, I will show you that not only is mandatory organ donation ethically justifiable, it is a necessary step toward saving countless lives, promoting justice, and upholding the social contract to which we all subscribe.

Every year, tens of thousands of people across the globe die waiting for organ transplants—people whose only hope of survival lies in the willingness and chance of donation. In our current opt-in, voluntary system, the demand for organs dramatically outstrips supply. According to the World Health Organization, for every available organ, there are several patients waiting, desperately hoping for a miracle that, for most, never comes. And let us be clear: behind every statistic is a real person, someone’s child, parent, or friend. A single donor can save up to eight lives and improve many more—yet, as a society, we continually fall devastatingly short.

The moral imperative becomes undeniable. Our interconnectedness as a community means that when we have the power to save lives at no cost to ourselves — once we no longer need our organs — withholding that lifeline is indefensible. Organ donation after death does not infringe upon the livelihood, freedom, or dignity of the deceased, but it offers an unparalleled opportunity for generosity – one final act benefiting fellows in need. Consider that when we walk on public roads, benefit from public hospitals, and educate our children in public schools, we accept certain mutual obligations. Choosing not to donate, when donation is medically viable and no harm is done to the self, is antithetical to this ethos of shared responsibility.

Now, one might argue that consent must be explicitly given, but we must ask why the default should be apathy when the cost of inaction is death. Evidence shows that in countries where an opt-out, presumed consent or mandatory donation model is in place — such as Spain — organ donation rates are far higher, and the gap between need and supply is dramatically reduced. The difference is not in individual willingness, but in systems; part of the tragedy in voluntary systems is frequently not a lack of personal generosity, but inertia, lack of awareness, and cumbersome administrative processes. By making organ donation mandatory, with robust ethical safeguards and allowance for certain religious or medical exemptions, we prioritize life.

Moreover, mandatory donation serves the principle of justice. Inequities in our current system disproportionately affect marginalized groups, the poor, and minorities, who are overrepresented on waiting lists and underrepresented among recipients, often due to systemic discrimination. When everyone is a donor by default, the pool becomes more reflective of the diversity of society, creating a more just and equitable allocation system.

There are those who may raise concerns about autonomy and bodily integrity. To them, we respond: autonomy cannot be absolute, especially in death, when the potential good is incalculable. In life, our autonomy is constrained where it risks serious harm to others—think of mandatory vaccinations, seat belt laws, or banning drunk driving. Organ donation, post-mortem, is a vastly less intrusive imposition, and one that directly saves lives.

In closing, we must not let tradition, discomfort, or inertia dictate a status quo that costs lives."
5c01f470-86ef-4844-b270-d7d6075b33b2,Organ donation should be mandatory,gpt-4.1,"Ladies and gentlemen, esteemed judges, honorable opponents, and members of the audience,

Today, I stand before you to advocate passionately in favor of the motion: Organ donation should be mandatory.

This is not merely a proposal about medical policy; it is an urgent matter of life, death, and our collective responsibility to one another. Every day, thousands die needlessly as they wait, often in agony, for the organ transplant that could save their lives. This is not due to a shortage of medical expertise, nor a lack of technology, but because the supply of donated organs falls woefully short of the desperate need.

Consider these stark figures: In our country alone, more than 100,000 individuals are currently waiting for a life-saving organ transplant. Every ten minutes, another person is added to that list. Yet, tragically, twenty people die every single day because an organ was not available in time. Behind each of these numbers is a mother, a father, a child, a loved one—someone who could have been saved if only an organ was available.

The current voluntary, opt-in system is fundamentally flawed. Studies repeatedly show that while over 90% of people say they support organ donation, less than half have registered as donors. Why the gap? The answer is simple: inertia, forgetfulness, misconceptions—even inaction born of good intentions. Good people, lost opportunities.

We have the power—the moral obligation—to end this preventable loss. By making organ donation mandatory, we say, as a society, that we value life above passive tradition or unnecessary taboo. We say that no one should die simply because a potential organ was buried or cremated instead of being used to save another’s life.

Mandatory organ donation would not only save tens of thousands of lives each year; it would also transform the ethical landscape of medicine. It ensures fairness, making organs available to all in need, regardless of their socioeconomic status, race, or location. It removes the current inequities fostered by an insufficient supply, black markets, and sometimes tragic, last-minute appeals that lead to emotional and economic devastation for families.

Moreover, mandatory organ donation preserves the utmost respect for autonomy through an ‘opt-out’ model, as seen in numerous countries with great success. In nations like Spain and Austria, citizens are presumed to consent to donation unless they explicitly refuse. These countries regularly achieve donation rates far higher than those who rely exclusively on volunteerism. The mandatory system respects individuals’ deeply held beliefs by allowing exemptions for genuine religious or medical reasons—but it sets the default in favor of compassion, not neglect.

Some may argue that mandating organ donation infringes upon personal liberty. But I ask: what higher use is there for the human body after death than to give someone else the gift of life? Just as society places boundaries on individual choices for the public good—such as mandatory vaccinations or seatbelt laws—it is not only permissible but essential to require organ donation to prevent avoidable suffering and death.

Let us also consider the ripple effects of such a policy. With routine availability of organs, scientific research and medical training would advance by leaps and bounds. Fewer families would face the agony of losing a loved one to organ failure. Economic analyses even show billions saved in chronic healthcare costs for patients otherwise left on expensive, lifelong treatments.

We are faced with a profound moral opportunity. To waste a viable organ, when another desperately needs it, is to turn our backs on our shared humanity."
e14bfd6c-a4ec-40ba-8ceb-a49b83223f15,We should abolish the needle exchange programs,gpt-4.1,"Ladies and gentlemen, honorable judges, esteemed opponents, and members of the audience,

Today, we gather to debate a topic of profound importance for our communities, our health systems, and the moral fabric of our society: ""We should abolish the needle exchange programs."" Our team stands firmly in support of this motion, and I am here to present the compelling reasons why needle exchange programs, though well-intentioned, must be abolished for the greater good.

Let us begin by examining the foundation on which needle exchange programs rest. Originating in the 1980s as a response to the AIDS crisis, these programs were intended as a harm reduction measure, providing clean syringes to drug users in the hopes of curbing the spread of infectious diseases such as HIV and Hepatitis C. While this approach may have yielded some short-term benefits, we must ask ourselves at what cost and what message we are sending to society at large.

Firstly, needle exchange programs enable and perpetuate illegal drug use. By supplying the tools required for injection, these programs tacitly condone the consumption of highly dangerous substances. This institutional approval undermines the foundational message that drug use is harmful and illegal. Imagine if society supported similar ""harm reduction"" strategies for other illegal or harmful acts; the moral and legal lines would blur beyond recognition. Instead of guiding addicts towards genuine recovery and a life free from drugs, needle exchange programs become a crutch, enabling ongoing, destructive behavior.

Secondly, these programs fail to address the root causes of addiction. Addiction is a complex, multidimensional issue often linked to mental health, trauma, socioeconomic status, and lack of opportunity. By focusing resources and attention on merely reducing one consequence of drug use, we divert effort and funding from comprehensive solutions—such as increased access to rehabilitation, mental health services, education, and employment opportunities—which aim to break the cycle of addiction. In many municipalities, scarce public funding that could support long-term recovery gets diverted to maintain these exchange programs year after year, effectively treating the symptom while ignoring the disease.

Moreover, the presence of needle exchange programs poses a tangible threat to public safety and community well-being. Neighborhoods hosting these facilities frequently report increased loitering, discarded syringes in parks and playgrounds, and a general perception of insecurity. Local businesses suffer, families feel unsafe, and property values decline. The rights of the broader community—children, parents, workers—are too often overshadowed by the focus on a small but vocal subset. We cannot allow the welfare of the many to be compromised by well-meaning but ultimately detrimental policies.

There is also the critical issue of accountability and law. Governments have a duty to uphold the law and foster a culture of responsibility. Needle exchange programs, by their very nature, facilitate the illegal consumption of controlled substances. This creates a paradoxical situation in which authorities are seen to support, if not outright sponsor, activities they simultaneously criminalize. Such mixed messaging erodes public trust in our laws and in our institutions, rendering them inconsistent and unclear.

Finally, abolishing needle exchange programs does not mean abandoning those struggling with addiction. On the contrary, it is a call to redirect our compassion and resources toward more effective, sustainable interventions. Recovery-focused programs—backed by robust mental health support, employment opportunities, and education—offer not just a safer way to use drugs, but a genuine way out of addiction. We must send a clear message that we believe in the potential for every individual to recover and reclaim their lives fully, rather than accepting perpetual dependency as the best outcome."
9eb88602-e3cb-4d84-a8ec-94e418bf2c1c,We should abolish the needle exchange programs,gpt-4.1,"Ladies and gentlemen, honorable judges, esteemed opponents,

Today, we stand before you to argue in resolute favor of the motion: ""We should abolish needle exchange programs."" 

At first glance, needle exchange programs, or NEPs, may appear to be a well-intentioned public health initiative—providing clean syringes to individuals who inject drugs in order to reduce the spread of bloodborne diseases. However, beneath their surface, these programs raise fundamental ethical, medical, and societal concerns that cannot be overlooked. I will demonstrate that NEPs not only fail to address the root causes of drug addiction, but also enable destructive behavior, endanger communities, and impede more effective solutions for substance abuse.

First and foremost, needle exchange programs send a dangerous message: that society tacitly condones illicit drug use. By facilitating access to drug paraphernalia, we erode the line between prevention and permissiveness. NEPs may be designed to mitigate risks, but in reality, they implicitly legitimize and even enable the continued use of dangerous substances such as heroin and methamphetamine. Instead of using our resources to encourage recovery and healthy choices, NEPs divert public funds to a harm reduction model that accepts addiction as a given, failing to support the life-saving principle of rehabilitation.

Furthermore, NEPs undermine the motivation for drug users to seek treatment. Addiction is a medical crisis, demanding a response anchored in rehabilitation and support. By making drug use safer, NEPs inadvertently remove one of the few remaining incentives for individuals to seek help—the negative health consequences of their behavior. Numerous studies have shown that successful recoveries often begin at a point of crisis. NEPs, by softening that crisis, can delay, or completely derail, the incentive to enter life-saving treatment. Instead, our resources should be invested in robust addiction treatment programs, counseling, and long-term support services—tools proven to lead to lasting recovery rather than perpetuating cycles of use.

Secondly, needle exchange programs present significant risks to public safety and community wellbeing. While supporters claim that these programs reduce disease, emerging evidence reveals unintended consequences. Discarded needles have become a blight on public streets, parks, and playgrounds—posing a direct threat to unsuspecting children and families. According to reports from several major cities, the proliferation of NEPs has correlated with a dramatic rise in needle litter, accidental needle sticks, and even increases in local crime rates. By centralizing the distribution of drug-use supplies, NEPs can inadvertently turn neighborhoods into magnet zones for drug-related activities, deterring businesses, eroding property values, and undermining the sense of safety essential to a thriving community.

Moreover, NEPs are an inefficient and unsustainable use of public funds. Taxpayers should not be expected to subsidize ongoing self-harm, when those same resources could be channeled into prevention education, mental health services, and drug enforcement efforts. Financing the distribution of free syringes, rather than funding true interventions, is a short-term bandage on a chronic hemorrhage. We must demand more from our policies—policies that offer hope, health, and restoration to those afflicted, not simply the means to continue their destructive patterns.

Finally, needle exchange programs suffer from a persistent lack of accountability. Despite years of implementation, there is scant conclusive evidence that they meaningfully reduce rates of disease transmission at a population level. Worse, they do not address the associated scourges of addiction—homelessness, unemployment, family breakdown—that devastate not only users, but their loved ones and neighborhoods. The hard truth is that NEPs fall short in every measurable respect: failing to heal, failing to restore, and failing to protect.

Ladies and gentlemen, it is time to reject the false comfort of half-measures."
5870fce5-5401-497f-954e-680fa533d16a,We should ban racial profiling,gpt-4.1,"Ladies and gentlemen, esteemed judges, and honorable opponents, 

Today, we stand before you to debate a matter that strikes at the very heart of justice, equality, and human dignity: whether we ought to ban racial profiling. Let us be unequivocal and firm in our conviction – racial profiling should be unequivocally banned. It is not only a matter of principle, but of practical necessity, ethical obligation, and societal benefit.

Racial profiling is the act of targeting individuals for suspicion of crime based on their race, ethnicity, or national origin. It is a practice that undermines the core foundational values of any free and fair society: equality before the law and respect for individual rights. At its root, racial profiling treats people not as individuals, but as mere representatives of a particular group. It replaces facts and evidence with suspicion based on superficial characteristics. This is not only irrational, but deeply unjust.

Let me begin with the moral imperative. Our societies have long recognized that discrimination is morally wrong. Documented in the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, the United States Constitution, and countless other national and international frameworks, the principle of equality underpins all legitimate legal systems. Racial profiling stands in direct violation of these values, ingraining systemic prejudice and perpetuating cycles of distrust and marginalization. It sends a message to entire communities that they are not trusted, not respected, and not truly part of the fabric of our nations. Banning racial profiling is not just a legal necessity—it is a moral one.

Some may argue that racial profiling is a pragmatic tool for law enforcement—an unfortunate necessity in the face of certain threats. But let us be clear: not only does this reasoning rest upon the dangerous assumption that entire groups are inherently suspicious, it is also factually unsound. Studies across the world, from the United States to Europe to Australia, have consistently shown that racial profiling is an ineffective law enforcement strategy. It leads to “false positives,” wasting resources on innocent people while the real perpetrators go undetected. For example, after the September 11 attacks, decades of research have shown that policies targeting Middle Eastern or Muslim individuals have failed to identify genuine risks and instead alienated critical communities whose trust and assistance law enforcement needs.

Let us also consider the damaging consequences of racial profiling. When groups are consistently singled out for scrutiny at airports, in traffic stops, or on the streets, this erodes trust in public institutions. Community cooperation with police and other authorities plummets. People who feel targeted are less likely to report crimes, act as witnesses, or work with investigators. This undermines not just individual freedom, but public safety as a whole. Law and order are bolstered not by suspicion and division, but by trust and partnership across all communities.

Moreover, we cannot ignore the long-lasting psychological harm caused by racial profiling. Children grow up internalizing the message that they are suspect because of how they look. Adults suffer humiliation, anxiety, and anger when they are treated as guilty until proven innocent. These are not minor inconveniences; they are traumas that ripple through generations and hinder social progress.

Some will try to disguise the case for racial profiling with statistics about differing crime rates. But correlation does not equal causation, and the use of data to justify discrimination creates self-perpetuating cycles. When law enforcement is disproportionately directed at certain communities, those communities become oversampled in crime statistics, thereby “confirming” biased assumptions and perpetuating profiling even further."
62985ae2-51fe-4992-afe7-dd36f6b6d9f6,We should ban racial profiling,gpt-4.1,"Ladies and gentlemen, esteemed judges, respected opponents, and members of the audience, today I stand firmly resolved that we should ban racial profiling in all its forms.

At its core, racial profiling is the practice of targeting individuals for suspicion of crime based on their race, ethnicity, or national origin, rather than any objective evidence of wrongdoing. While some assert this might be a useful shortcut for law enforcement, the practice fundamentally undermines the principles of justice, equality, and human rights that underpin our society. Allow me to present the strongest case for why a ban on racial profiling is not only necessary, but long overdue.

First, racial profiling is a blatant violation of individual rights and the principle of equality before the law. Every person deserves to be judged on the basis of their actions, not on the color of their skin or the country of their ancestors. The Universal Declaration of Human Rights, adopted in 1948, proclaims that “all human beings are born free and equal in dignity and rights.” Racial profiling, by treating certain groups as inherently suspicious, violates this fundamental moral law and stains the very ideals of our democratic societies.

Second, racial profiling is not only morally indefensible, but also ineffective and counterproductive as a law enforcement tool. When police base their suspicions on race rather than evidence, resources are diverted away from real threats and genuine criminal activity. Numerous studies have demonstrated that profiling by race or ethnicity does not improve crime detection rates. In fact, it can cloud judgment, leading officers to overlook real suspects if they do not fit a racialized profile, while innocent individuals endure scrutiny and trauma. This approach breeds resentment and alienation in minority communities, undermining cooperation with law enforcement—the very cooperation needed to keep all of us safe.

To illustrate, consider the experience of airports following 9/11. The targeting of passengers based on appearance did not enhance security, but instead led to widespread distress, embarrassment, and anger, while failing to prevent incidents. Only when authorities shifted toward more comprehensive, behavior-based screening and intelligence-sharing did airport security measurably improve. The lesson is clear: bias does not deliver safety.

Third, racial profiling perpetuates and amplifies systemic discrimination. Disproportionate stops, searches, and arrests send a dangerous message to society—that some people are inherently less trustworthy, less worthy of protection, or more deserving of suspicion than others. This breeds cycles of mistrust and suspicion that extend far beyond the immediate victims. Young people who grow up witnessing or experiencing profiling internalize a sense of alienation and injustice, eroding their trust not only in police, but in all society’s institutions—the legal system, schools, and government itself. We must ask ourselves: what kind of society are we building if generation after generation learns to see authority as a threat rather than a protector?

There is also a profound economic and social cost to maintaining racial profiling. Wrongful stops, arrests, detentions, and the legal proceedings that follow consume vast public resources and subject individuals to potentially life-altering consequences of missed work, increased stress, and lost opportunities. Meanwhile, communities as a whole suffer lowered economic productivity, weakened social cohesion, and increased healthcare needs stemming from the fear and trauma inflicted by discriminatory policies.

Finally, racial profiling is at odds with core constitutional values. In the United States, the Fourth and Fourteenth Amendments guarantee protection from unreasonable searches and equal protection under the law. Banning racial profiling is not just a moral imperative, but a constitutional necessity—a recognition that safety and fairness are not mutually exclusive, but must go hand in hand."
43bc76ee-1bf6-4eea-b859-5d2f44c3b029,We should ban algorithmic trading,gpt-4.1,"Ladies and gentlemen, esteemed judges, and honorable opponents:

Imagine, if you will, the heartbeat of the world’s financial markets—billions of dollars moving in the blink of an eye, with the fate of entire economies swayed by entities faster, colder, and more relentless than any human could ever hope to be. These entities are not bound by fear, reason, or conscience. They operate purely on logic—ones and zeroes—reacting to the slightest changes in market conditions. They are not investors; they are algorithms. Today, I stand before you to argue that we should ban algorithmic trading.

Let us begin by acknowledging the profound transformation algorithmic trading has wrought upon global markets. Once, stock exchanges were bustling centers filled with passionate professionals making decisions based on analysis, instinct, and experience. Now, the majority of trades are conducted by algorithms—computers programmed to exploit market inefficiencies for profit, executing thousands of trades per second. This is not technological progress; it is a hijacking of our markets.

First and foremost, algorithmic trading undermines market stability. The notorious “Flash Crash” of May 6th, 2010, is a somber testament—within minutes, the Dow Jones Industrial Average plummeted nearly 1,000 points before recovering just as swiftly. The culprits? High-speed algorithmic traders, whose massive, rapid transactions triggered a cascade of automated selling. This was not an isolated incident. Multiple studies, including those by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission, have linked algorithmic trading to intensified market volatility and sudden, drastic price swings. When algorithms dominate, they amplify minute disturbances into full-blown storms. In these artificial tempests, ordinary investors—retirees, students, families—are left paying the price for a system rigged against them.

Second, algorithmic trading erodes trust and fairness. The foundation of any market is the belief that buyers and sellers compete on a level playing field. Algorithms, especially in high-frequency trading, destroy this premise. These machines capitalize on minute price movements and minute advantages measured in microseconds. They front-run slower participants—buying or selling milliseconds before everyone else, not through superior insight or judgment, but by virtue of having better technology. This is not healthy competition; it is technological cheating. Ordinary investors are at the mercy of black-box codes that they do not understand and cannot hope to outpace.

Moreover, algorithmic trading does not serve the real economy. The justification for its existence is often the promise of “liquidity” and “market efficiency.” However, research shows that this liquidity is phantom—present only in times of calm, vanishing when volatility strikes. And what have these so-called “efficiencies” achieved? They have not improved the allocation of capital to productive uses. They have merely enriched a select few firms, diverting resources away from long-term investment and economic growth.

Let us also not ignore the systematic risk posed by these algorithms. These programs are designed by humans but act autonomously, and their complexity creates dangers we do not fully understand. A single coding error can propagate through the system, causing billions in damage. No amount of post-hoc regulation can keep pace with the speed or the unpredictability of algorithms operating in tandem. The financial crisis taught us the dangers of opaque, poorly understood financial products. Algorithmic trading is no different—it is a black box packed with dynamite.

Finally, ask yourselves: What do we lose by banning algorithmic trading? We lose the ability for machines to outperform humans through raw speed, yes. But we gain a financial system reclaimed for reason, prudence, and fairness—one that rewards knowledge and judgment over microsecond advantage. We restore faith that the market exists to serve the economy, not to exploit its cracks."
8fefdf57-3a50-4b13-8cbe-1099b37b9dad,We should ban algorithmic trading,gpt-4.1,"Honourable judges, esteemed opponents, and valued audience,

Today, we stand at the crossroads of morality, market stability, and technological advancement as we discuss whether algorithmic trading should be banned. I rise to affirm the motion: “We should ban algorithmic trading.” This is not a rejection of technology itself, but a call for responsible stewardship of our financial markets and the protection of society’s economic wellbeing.

To understand why a ban is necessary, let us first define algorithmic trading. It refers to the use of computer algorithms—sophisticated, automated programs—to execute trades at speeds and frequencies that far surpass human capability. Far from leveling the playing field, this practice has concentrated power and information in the hands of a technological elite, transforming our financial markets from engines of real-world investment into playing fields for high-frequency profit and excessive risk.

Let me present three core arguments: systemic risk and market instability, unfairness and inequality, and the distortion of the economy’s true purpose.

First, systemic risk and market instability. Algorithimic trading, particularly in its high-frequency forms, introduces unprecedented volatility and fragility into our financial systems. Unlike human traders, algorithms can respond to minute changes in market data with lightning speed—sometimes in milliseconds. While proponents claim this creates liquidity, history demonstrates it can also create chaos. The Flash Crash of May 6, 2010, is a glaring example: within minutes, nearly a trillion dollars vanished and markets spiraled, simply because algorithms fed off each other’s trades in a self-reinforcing loop. These flash crashes are not aberrations; they are symptoms of deeper, structural instability. Algorithmic strategies, designed for speed and exploitation, can propagate errors faster than humans can react, making markets vulnerable to enormous shocks—shocks that threaten not only investments but the savings, pensions, and livelihoods of countless ordinary people.

Second, unfairness and the erosion of equality. Algorithmic trading exacerbates inequality within the financial system. Access to cutting-edge technology, proximity to data centers, and ownership of premium algorithms are advantages only the wealthiest institutions and individuals can afford. This leads to a two-tier system: those with algorithms reap outsized profits, often at the expense of the slower, less technologically advanced investors. It is like allowing a race where some run on wheels and others on foot. Retail investors, pension funds, and smaller market players are left disadvantaged, their trades front-run and their opportunities diminished. Far from democratizing finance, algorithmic trading has entrenched privilege and widened the gap between Wall Street and Main Street.

Third, distorted markets and the abandonment of the real economy. Financial markets were created to connect savers and investors with those who need capital to build businesses, create jobs, and drive innovation. Yet, algorithmic trading increasingly sidelines this mission. When market participants trade not for investment, but for fleeting, microsecond profits, the market’s function as a resource allocator is corrupted. Artificial volatility, manipulation—for example, through ""spoofing"" or placing false orders—and the extraction of value from genuine participants all divert resources away from productive investment toward pure speculation.

Some may argue that regulation, not prohibition, is the answer. However, the pace of technological advancement in algorithmic trading always outstrips regulation. Regulators can neither match the speed nor predict the complexity of algorithmic behavior. A piecemeal, reactive approach will not repair fundamental flaws.

In conclusion, the rise of algorithmic trading represents a clear and present danger to financial market stability, fairness, and economic purpose. It amplifies systemic risk, entrenches inequality, and distorts the market’s primary function."
87336f88-f79f-40d8-aef7-b58d299dd04d,The right to Internet access should be protected,gpt-4.1,"Honorable judges, respected opponents, members of the audience, 

Today, I stand before you to advocate for a principle that is rapidly becoming essential to our modern way of life: that the right to Internet access should be protected.

Let me begin by posing a fundamental question—what does it mean to have rights in the 21st century? If we look to history, rights have always stemmed from necessity. The right to education, the right to free speech, and the right to assembly all emerged as vital to individual dignity and the progress of our societies. Today, the Internet is as woven into the fabric of daily life as the printing press, the telephone, or indeed the roads that connect us. To deny someone access to it is to deny their full participation in society.

The Internet is no longer a luxury or a mere convenience; it has become the backbone of our economic, social, and political structures. According to the United Nations, more than five billion people use the Internet worldwide. Why? Because access to the Internet empowers. It provides people with the opportunity to communicate, to learn, to work, and to participate in civic life on an unprecedented scale.

First, let’s consider the Internet’s role in education. In countless countries, students depend on the Internet to access textbooks, attend virtual classes, and communicate with teachers and peers. During the COVID-19 pandemic, the critical nature of Internet access became glaringly apparent as millions of children were unable to continue their education simply because they were offline. To protect the right to education, we must, thus, protect the right to Internet access.

Second, Internet access is a lifeline for economic opportunity. The rise of remote work, online businesses, and digital marketplaces means that employment and entrepreneurship are increasingly tied to digital connectivity. Without reliable Internet, large swaths of the population are shut out of economic participation—not by merit or ability, but by circumstance. This perpetuates cycles of poverty and widens social inequality.

Moreover, let’s reflect on the Internet’s power to amplify voices and foster democratic engagement. Activists, citizens, and marginalized communities can organize, mobilize, and hold their leaders accountable thanks to online platforms. In environments where traditional media is censored, the Internet often becomes the only venue for free speech and dissent. By protecting Internet access, we do not merely defend technology; we defend democracy itself.

Some may argue that Internet access is a service, not a right—that it should be regulated by market forces or left to individual responsibility. However, we have seen, time and again, that where vital infrastructure is left to profit margins, the most vulnerable are neglected. Rural areas, the poor, people with disabilities—these are the groups most often denied access when there is no recognized right to connectivity. It is exactly for them that this protection is most necessary.

Let me be clear: to protect the right to Internet access is not to advocate for unfettered, unregulated cyberspace. Rather, it is to assert that, in an age where so much opportunity, knowledge, and civic life depends on this technology, no person should be arbitrarily excluded from it. It is to say that just as no one should be denied water, electricity, or literacy, neither should they be denied the main avenue for participation in modern society.

In conclusion, the right to Internet access is a matter of equity, necessity, and justice. It is the foundation upon which education, employment, social inclusion, and democracy itself now depend. To protect it is not only practical but profoundly moral."
2652a02f-8939-48ad-b6b3-ce52a9cf818e,The right to Internet access should be protected,gpt-4.1,"Ladies and gentlemen, respected judges, esteemed opponents, and fellow audience members, 

Today, I stand unwaveringly in support of the motion: ""The right to Internet access should be protected."" In an era defined by digital transformation, we must recognize that access to the Internet is not a luxury, but a fundamental necessity—one that underpins the exercise of essential human rights, sustains economic growth, empowers civic participation, and advances social development.

Allow me to begin by highlighting the intrinsic connection between Internet access and basic human rights. The Universal Declaration of Human Rights enshrines the right to freedom of expression, the right to education, and the right to participate in cultural life. In today’s interconnected world, the Internet has become the primary vehicle for exercising these rights. Freedom of expression increasingly relies on digital platforms to communicate ideas and engage in dialogue across borders. Education, at every level and across all geographies, is now deeply intertwined with digital resources—the inability to access these resources exacerbates existing inequalities and deprives individuals of fully realizing their potential.

The COVID-19 pandemic offered a sobering illustration of this reality: those without Internet access were cut off from school, services, employment, medical advice, and even social connection. How can we accept a reality where a child’s educational future or a family’s livelihoods hinge on the happenstance of birth, geography, or economic circumstance? To safeguard equality and justice, we must protect Internet access as a right—not a privilege—ensuring that no one is left stranded on the margins of our society.

Secondly, let us consider the Internet’s central role in economic participation. In the modern economy, virtually every field—from agriculture to manufacturing, healthcare to retail—depends on digital infrastructure. The United Nations estimates that digital inclusion could add trillions of dollars to the global economy, lifting millions out of poverty. For small businesses, especially in developing regions, Internet access is the difference between stagnation and the chance to compete on the world stage. Workers use the Internet to find jobs, gain new skills, and build livelihoods. Denying this connective lifeline is not merely inconvenient; it is economically debilitating and unfairly perpetuates cycles of poverty.

Thirdly, the Internet is now indispensable to civic engagement and democracy. Social media and digital tools facilitate organizing, campaigning, and demanding accountability, while government services—voting, information dissemination, public consultations—are increasingly digital by default. When access is curtailed, whether by government policy, cost barriers, or infrastructural neglect, the result is a muted citizenry, a democracy impoverished. Only by universally protecting Internet access can we ensure that every voice has the means to be heard and that governments remain answerable to all their citizens.

Some may argue that Internet access cannot be deemed a right because it is a technology, not a natural entitlement. Yet time and again, technological advancements—from printing presses to telephones—have shaped new frontiers of rights protection. Just as literacy was recognized as a key to autonomy in the 20th century, digital literacy and access are the gateways to participation, dignity, and opportunity in the 21st. To deny this is to consign millions to second-class citizenship.

Additionally, protecting the right to Internet access does not mean mandating luxury, unfettered, or unsafe access. It means committing as a society to removing unreasonable barriers—to ensuring broadband is affordable, reliable, and accessible; to defending against unreasonable censorship; and to providing the tools and training necessary for all to navigate the Internet securely.

In conclusion, the right to Internet access is not simply about technology—it is about justice, equality, and the very fabric of modern citizenship."
5d854606-bba7-48b7-8099-a0cb47cf90f4,We should ban alternative medicine,gpt-4.1,"Ladies and gentlemen, esteemed judges, and respected opponents,

Today, we stand at a critical crossroads in the world of healthcare—one that demands our courage, our reason, and our unwavering commitment to public well-being. The motion before us, “We should ban alternative medicine,” is not simply a matter of professional rivalry or philosophical difference. It is a call to protect our communities from harm, to uphold scientific integrity, and to ensure that every person receives effective and safe medical care. I stand firmly in support of this motion, and I invite you all to consider the overwhelming evidence, the unmistakable ethical imperatives, and the very real human costs at stake.

First and foremost, alternative medicine is, by definition, not evidence-based. While modern medicine is subjected to rigorous clinical trials, peer review, and continual scrutiny, alternative therapies—ranging from homeopathy, reiki, and crystal healing to unproven herbal supplements—often operate outside this critical framework. They promise relief without proof, healing without evidence, and hope without accountability. This is not simply a benign choice; it is a profound betrayal of basic medical ethics.

Consider the very real risks. When patients choose unproven alternatives over evidence-based treatments, they are not just wasting money—they are gambling with their health, and sometimes their lives. A study in the Journal of the National Cancer Institute found that cancer patients who opted for alternative therapies in place of conventional treatments were more than twice as likely to die within five years. Anecdotes abound of individuals eschewing life-saving interventions for the empty promises of “natural cures.” This is not harmless; this is deadly. As a society, we have a responsibility to protect the vulnerable and the ill from such catastrophic misinformation.

Proponents of alternative medicine often argue for “freedom of choice.” But true freedom requires reliable information. When the public is routinely misled—by charismatic practitioners, misleading advertising, and influencers without scientific grounding—they cannot make informed choices. Banning alternative medicine is not about restricting freedom; it is about upholding truth in healthcare. It is about ensuring that when people seek help for their most urgent needs, they are met with treatments that actually work.

Moreover, the persistence of alternative medicine undermines trust in science. When unproven therapies are marketed alongside legitimate medical breakthroughs, the line between evidence and anecdote blurs. The result? A society less likely to vaccinate, more susceptible to conspiracy theories, and deeply confused about what works and what does not. In an era where misinformation travels faster than truth, we simply cannot afford to let pseudoscience masquerade as medicine.

Some may question: “What about the placebo effect?” While it is true that belief can sometimes yield subjective improvements, we must ask—at what cost? Should we endorse deception as treatment? Should we profit from hope, when that hope is baseless? The answer must be no. The placebo effect does not require the trappings of alternative medicine; compassionate, evidence-based care can harness the same psychological benefits with honesty and efficacy.

To be clear, banning alternative medicine does not mean closing the door on progress. It challenges us to evaluate promising therapies using the scientific method, and, if they are shown to be effective, to integrate them into conventional medicine—where they belong. History demonstrates that truly effective treatments, whatever their origin, are eventually embraced by mainstream medical science.

In conclusion, the case for banning alternative medicine is about more than doctrine—it is about the health, safety, and dignity of every person. It is about drawing a clear line between what heals and what harms; between medicine and mere myth."
4984bbba-203d-447c-94df-908db7aec22e,We should ban alternative medicine,gpt-4.1,"Ladies and gentlemen, honorable judges, esteemed opponents, and valued audience members, thank you for the opportunity to open today's crucial debate on the motion: ""We should ban alternative medicine.""

Let me begin with a clear definition: by ""alternative medicine,"" we refer to treatments or practices that lie outside the realm of scientific consensus and established medical protocols—modalities such as homeopathy, unverified herbal remedies, energy healing, and the plethora of unregulated therapies not supported by robust, peer-reviewed evidence of safety and efficacy.

I stand firmly in support of a ban on alternative medicine, and I will structure my case around three fundamental arguments: patient safety, public health, and the ethical responsibility society holds toward truth and protection from harm.

Firstly, let us examine the matter of patient safety—a core principle of healthcare. Modern medicine is held to rigorous standards. New drugs and procedures are subjected to painstaking clinical trials, oversight by regulatory agencies, and constant scrutiny by the scientific community. Why? Because when it comes to health, the stakes could not be higher. In stark contrast, alternative medicine operates in the shadows, free from standardized regulations, or scientific validation. Many alternative therapies can be not just ineffective, but actively dangerous. Consider the myriad cases where individuals have consumed toxic herbal concoctions, or turned to faith healers in lieu of timely, life-saving intervention. According to the World Health Organization, improper use of non-conventional medicine has resulted in thousands of injuries and deaths globally. A ban is the only responsible answer to stem the tide of these preventable tragedies.

Secondly, let us confront the public health implications. Widespread use and open promotion of unproven therapies undermine trust in evidence-based care. This is not a mere theoretical concern: when people believe that untested ointments or homeopathic pellets can cure serious illnesses, they often forgo effective medical treatment, delaying diagnosis and allowing diseases—from cancer to diabetes—to progress unchecked. Alternative medicine, by masquerading as legitimate therapy, actively sabotages public health campaigns, erodes herd immunity, and, most egregiously, feeds vaccine hesitancy and other forms of modern medical skepticism. The proliferation of misinformation enabled by the alternative medicine industry comes with dire consequences, from the resurgence of preventable illnesses to the loss of countless lives.

Thirdly, there is an ethical duty to uphold truth, accountability, and protection from charlatanism. Those advocating alternative medicine often make unscrupulous claims, promising miraculous cures with no scientific foundation. Vulnerable populations—immune-compromised individuals, cancer patients, parents desperate for answers—are routinely exploited. We do not allow unlicensed engineers to build bridges, or unregulated pilots to fly planes. Why should we allow untrained, unaccountable practitioners to gamble with human health? The ban of alternative medicine is a moral imperative to safeguard the public from manipulation, false hope, and outright fraud. It is an affirmation of the society we wish to build: one where truth triumphs over deception, where lives are valued over profit, and where all citizens receive care rooted in proven science, not superstition.

Some may argue that banning alternative medicine infringes on freedom of choice. Let us be clear: individual liberty does not extend to the right to harm oneself or others based on disinformation. Just as society justifiably prohibits dangerous drugs and unlicensed surgeries, we have a duty to act against unproven medicine that endangers lives.

In conclusion, a ban on alternative medicine is not just an act of policy—it is an act of compassion, responsibility, and respect for truth. It is time to prioritize safety, protect vulnerable individuals, and recommit to the only form of medicine that history, science, and morality support: evidence-based care."
2f243708-458d-4634-a2bd-8ab517b68871,We should protect Antarctica,gpt-4.1,"Honorable judges, esteemed opponents, and distinguished audience, today we gather to address a topic of profound global significance: “We should protect Antarctica.”

Antarctica—the last true wilderness on Earth. A continent twice the size of Australia, encased in ice, ringed by tempestuous seas, and crowned by endless white silence. At first glance, it may seem remote, barren, and inhospitable. Yet, I stand before you to assert, unequivocally: The protection of Antarctica is not merely an environmental preference. It is an urgent, universal, and moral imperative with implications for every nation, every community, and every living being on this planet.

Let us begin by considering the environmental importance of Antarctica. Antarctica is often called the “heartbeat of the Earth’s climate system.” Its massive ice sheets contain nearly 70% of the world’s fresh water. These ice sheets reflect enormous amounts of solar radiation, helping to regulate our planet’s temperature and stabilize climate patterns. If we fail to protect this fragile environment from exploitation or warming, the consequences are catastrophic: rising sea levels that threaten coastal cities from New York to Mumbai, the collapse of vital ocean currents—the global climate thrown into chaos.

But Antarctica is more than just ice. It is a unique, irreplaceable ecosystem, home to astounding biodiversity that exists nowhere else. The Southern Ocean teems with krill, the foundational species for blue whales, penguins, and seals. Subglacial lakes may hold clues to ancient life—and even possibilities for future medical breakthroughs. Disturbing these delicately balanced systems through pollution, overfishing, or resource extraction would not only decimate unique species, but also erase secrets of nature that could benefit all humankind.

One might argue, “Why should we care for an uninhabited wasteland?” To answer, consider that Antarctica matters not in spite of its isolation, but because of it. It is one of the few places on Earth that remains relatively untouched by human hands—a living laboratory, and a baseline against which to measure the impacts of climate change and pollution elsewhere. Scientists travel from across the globe to study ozone depletion, shifting ice, and ancient atmospheres trapped in layers of snow. Their discoveries inform the international treaties that protect our air, water, and health. Without the preservation of Antarctica’s unique environment, this crucible of discovery will be forever lost.

Furthermore, the protection of Antarctica represents a remarkable achievement of international cooperation. The Antarctic Treaty, signed in 1959 by 12 nations, set aside this continent for peace and science. To this day, it prohibits military activity, mineral mining, and nuclear testing. It fosters collaboration even among rivals, proving that humanity can come together to protect the common good. But treaties are paper shields; they require vigilance and renewed commitment. As technology advances and pressures mount—for fish, minerals, even tourism—now is the moment to reaffirm and strengthen our resolve to protect Antarctica, not weaken it.

Opponents may claim that exploiting Antarctica’s natural resources could relieve resource scarcity or generate economic growth. Yet this argument is short-sighted. The profits from plundering this continent are dwarfed by the long-term dangers: irreversible environmental damage, species extinction, and devastating impacts on global communities as climate change accelerates. There can be no sustainable development without a stable environment. In prioritizing short-term gains over planetary health, we risk sacrificing the future not only of Antarctica, but of every nation on Earth.

In conclusion, we must protect Antarctica because it is vital to our climate stability, home to unique life, a beacon of peaceful cooperation, and a treasure trove of scientific discovery."
85bf5e29-abe2-46ea-a6f7-50e5bf1bd752,We should protect Antarctica,gpt-4.1,"Honorable judges, esteemed opponents, and valued audience, today I stand before you to advocate for a vital cause—the protection of Antarctica. In a world increasingly aware of environmental fragility and global interconnectedness, few places are as emblematic of both our planet’s peril and promise as this vast southern continent. I urge you to consider not only Antarctica’s chilling beauty, but more importantly, its irreplaceable role in preserving the health and future of our planet.

First, Antarctica is a cornerstone of the Earth’s climate system. The continent’s immense ice sheets contain around 60% of the world’s fresh water and approximately 90% of its ice. These ice sheets reflect solar radiation, helping to maintain the delicate balance of temperatures across the globe. If we fail to protect Antarctica, we risk accelerated melting, which could trigger catastrophic sea-level rise, threatening coastal cities, economies, and livelihoods worldwide. By safeguarding Antarctica, we defend not just a remote wilderness, but the very stability of our climate and the security of millions.

Second, Antarctica is a sanctuary for unique and threatened biodiversity. Despite its extreme conditions, this continent harbors remarkable life forms: penguins, seals, whales, and countless smaller creatures adapted to conditions found nowhere else on Earth. Many of these species are already facing unprecedented stresses from climate change, overfishing, and pollution. Extinction here is irreversible, and the loss of these creatures would impoverish the planet’s natural heritage. Moreover, the fragile food webs of Antarctica are intricately linked to global marine ecosystems. Disrupt them, and we risk ripple effects impacting fisheries, biodiversity, and human sustenance across the world.

Third, Antarctica is a living natural laboratory. Its isolation and pristine conditions offer scientists unparalleled opportunities to study climate change, ecosystem dynamics, and even potential cures for diseases. From drilling ancient ice cores to unravel 800,000 years of climate history, to investigating extremophilic microorganisms with potential pharmaceutical applications, research in Antarctica has already benefited humanity in countless ways. But such research relies on the continent remaining untouched by commercial exploitation and environmental degradation. To protect Antarctica is to invest in continued scientific discovery and, by extension, in our own prosperity and survival.

Fourth, Antarctica stands as humanity’s last great wilderness—a place governed not by a single nation, but by a remarkable example of international cooperation. The Antarctic Treaty of 1959, currently signed by 54 countries, commits the world to preserve the continent for peace and science. This treaty is a beacon of hope, demonstrating that collaborative stewardship is not only possible, but immensely beneficial. However, the treaty faces mounting pressures: from countries eager to exploit mineral and oil resources, to illegal fishing operations, to the specter of territorial disputes. If we fail to reinforce our commitment to protect Antarctica, we risk unraveling this historic achievement and setting a dangerous precedent for unchecked resource exploitation elsewhere.

Lastly, to protect Antarctica is not merely a matter of preservation—it is a matter of moral responsibility. The choices we make about Antarctica define the kind of stewards we wish to be for our planet. Will we prioritize short-term profit, or long-term planetary wellbeing? Will we honor our duty to future generations by preserving one of Earth’s last unspoiled places, or will we allow greed and neglect to erase its wonders forever?

In conclusion, the imperative to protect Antarctica is clear and urgent."
b1f5366a-0160-45b1-9d59-2f0df4c6ea40,We should fight global warming,gpt-4.1,"Honorable judges, esteemed opponents, and valued audience members,

Today, we stand before you to affirm a universal imperative: we should fight global warming. This is not merely a suggestion—it is a necessity for the survival and prosperity of our civilization. The evidence is overwhelming, the risks are catastrophic, and the solutions are within our reach. To do anything less than fight global warming is to disregard our moral obligations, our scientific understanding, and our collective future.

Let us begin with the irrefutable facts. Global warming, driven predominantly by the emission of greenhouse gases from human activities, is heating our planet at an unprecedented rate. According to the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC), the Earth's average surface temperature has already increased by over 1 degree Celsius since the late 19th century, with most of this warming occurring in recent decades. This is not a distant threat for future generations—this is a crisis affecting us right now.

The consequences of global warming are already profound and devastating. We witness it through more frequent and destructive hurricanes, wildfires that ravage communities, devastating droughts that threaten food security, and rising sea levels that endanger millions living in coastal areas. It is the melting of glaciers, the bleaching of coral reefs, the extinction of species. It is the increased burden of heat waves, withering crops, and spread of vector-borne diseases. Every continent, every country, and every person is affected—no one is immune.

But why must we fight? First and foremost, fighting global warming is a matter of survival—for ourselves and for generations yet unborn. The World Health Organization estimates that, between 2030 and 2050, climate change could cause approximately 250,000 additional deaths per year from malnutrition, malaria, diarrhea, and heat stress. If we fail to act, the consequences will only accelerate and grow worse.

Second, fighting global warming is an unprecedented moral obligation. Our actions, or lack thereof, directly affect the most vulnerable among us—those in developing nations, small island states, and disadvantaged communities, despite their bearing the least responsibility for emissions. Justice requires us to act in solidarity and protect those who will bear the brunt of impacts they did little to cause.

Third, we are presented with an incredible economic opportunity. Transitioning to a low-carbon economy sparks innovation, stimulates jobs, and makes economic sense. The International Renewable Energy Agency estimates that investment in renewables could create up to 42 million jobs by 2050. Energy efficiency measures, green infrastructure, and sustainable technologies benefit our economies, reduce air pollution, and create healthier communities.

Opponents may argue that fighting global warming is costly or disruptive. But let us be clear: the costs of inaction far exceed the costs of action. The Stern Review on the Economics of Climate Change famously concluded that the price of doing nothing could amount to between 5% and 20% of global GDP annually, due to damages, lost productivity, and health costs. Conversely, acting now will minimize these costs and fuel lasting growth.

Furthermore, we possess the tools and technology today to combat this crisis. Renewable energy is already cheaper than fossil fuels in many markets. Cities, companies, and nations around the world are setting ambitious goals and achieving real results. From reforestation to carbon capture, energy efficiency to innovation in transportation, we are not helpless; we are empowered.

The fight against global warming is not just about fear and survival. It is the ultimate expression of our ability to cooperate, innovate, and rise to meet the challenges of our time. It is the opportunity to secure a just, healthy, and thriving planet for ourselves and every generation that follows."
f1f76d01-dc5c-4548-ba01-ce7e6133e84e,We should fight global warming,gpt-4.1,"Ladies and gentlemen, esteemed judges, honorable opponents, and respected audience,

Today, I rise to affirm the motion: “We should fight global warming.” This is not merely an environmental issue; it is the defining challenge of our generation—one that transcends borders, politics, and personal beliefs. Fighting global warming is not a choice. It is an urgent necessity for the survival, health, prosperity, and security of humanity. 

Let us begin with clarity: global warming refers to the long-term, unnatural rise in Earth’s average surface temperature due to increased greenhouse gas emissions from human activities—most notably, the burning of fossil fuels, deforestation, and industrial practices. The scientific consensus is overwhelming. Over 97% of actively publishing climate scientists agree that global warming is real, and primarily caused by humans.

Why should we fight global warming? The answer is simple: to preserve our very way of life. Allow me to lay out four compelling reasons—science, human welfare, economic stability, and the moral obligation we hold to future generations.

First, the science is irrefutable. The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, representing the world’s foremost climate scientists, warns of catastrophic consequences if we allow temperatures to rise even 1.5°C above pre-industrial levels. We are already witnessing faster melting of polar ice caps, rising sea levels, and more frequent, devastating natural disasters. From the wildfires that ravage Australia and California to the floods displacing millions in Bangladesh, the evidence is neither abstract nor far away. It is here. It is now.

Second, the impact on human welfare cannot be overstated. According to the World Health Organization, between 2030 and 2050, climate change is expected to cause approximately 250,000 additional deaths per year due to malnutrition, malaria, diarrhea, and heat stress—ailments that disproportionately affect the poor and vulnerable. Crops are failing in some of the world’s most food-insecure regions. Clean water is becoming scarcer. Habitats are disappearing, forcing mass migrations and fueling conflicts. If we do not act, we condemn billions to a future marked by famine, disease, displacement, and suffering.

Third, fighting global warming is not only an environmental imperative, but also an economic one. The cost of inaction far outweighs the cost of action. According to the Stern Review, ignoring global warming could cause up to a 20% reduction in global GDP each year. In contrast, taking decisive steps now—by investing in renewable energy, adaptation strategies, and green infrastructure—would cost just 1% of global GDP annually, and would create millions of new jobs, spurring innovation and economic growth. The choice is clear: a green economy is not a burden, but an opportunity.

Fourth and finally, we have a moral obligation. We inherited a world of astounding beauty and bounty. Are we prepared to hand our children a scorched earth, unlivable cities, and shattered ecosystems? Our actions—or inactions—directly affect generations yet unborn. Justice, compassion, and decency demand that we confront this threat not with cynicism or apathy, but with courage and determination.

Opponents may argue that the task is too vast, the costs too high, or the technological solutions too insufficient. But such defeatism belies the remarkable progress we have already achieved. From plummeting costs of wind and solar energy, to multilateral agreements like the Paris Accord, to the grassroots mobilizations of millions of citizens worldwide, we have proven that positive action is not just possible—it is happening.

Ladies and gentlemen, history will judge us not by our intentions, but by our actions. Let us rise above short-term interests and timid excuses. Let us lead, innovate, and cooperate."
c281a4b2-0a9b-4792-a761-9a99c577d0b2,We should legalize ivory trade,gpt-4.1,"Ladies and gentlemen, honorable judges, and respected opponents,

Today, we stand at a crossroads—a crossroads that demands we put aside preconceived notions and look hard at the realities of conservation, economics, and ethics. The motion before us is this: We should legalize the ivory trade. I stand firmly in affirmation of this motion, and I invite you to consider how the legalization of ivory trade, if executed with well-planned regulation, is not only a rational solution but also a necessary one for the preservation of elephants, the prosperity of local communities, and the global fight against illegal trafficking.

Let us begin by recognizing an undeniable truth: the current ban on ivory trade is simply not working. Despite international prohibitions, the black market for ivory thrives. According to the United Nations, tens of thousands of elephants are killed every year for their tusks, not in countries where ivory trade is open and monitored, but in places where enforcement is lax and market forces go underground. The consequence? Instead of saving elephants, the ban has created a lucrative incentive for poaching, empowering organized crime syndicates and further destabilizing already vulnerable regions.

Legalizing and strictly regulating the ivory trade offers us a tangible solution. By infusing the trade with transparency and oversight, we can address the economic root causes that drive poaching, rather than simply treating its symptoms. Namibia, Botswana, Zimbabwe, and South Africa have successfully managed protected elephant populations, in part because they have utilized sustainable and controlled ivory sales to fund conservation efforts. When the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species allowed one-time legal ivory sales from these countries, revenues were reinvested directly into anti-poaching patrols, community development, and education. The result was not the decimation of elephant populations but their robust growth where these policies were faithfully implemented.

Moreover, we must acknowledge the rights, needs, and voices of the people who live side by side with elephants. For millions across Africa, elephants are not just majestic symbols—they are neighbors that compete for land, destroy crops, and sometimes threaten lives. Local communities bear the cost of these human-wildlife conflicts, yet they are often excluded from the benefits of ivory. Legalizing the trade and ensuring its proceeds flow back to these communities not only provides critical incentives for conservation but also social justice.

Furthermore, let us not overlook the critical importance of reducing demand in illegal markets. History and economics teach us that when supply of an item is cut off, prices skyrocket and criminals fill the vacuum. Prohibition has never worked as intended—whether for alcohol, drugs, or indeed, ivory. A well-regulated legal supply, on the other hand, can undercut illegal profiteers, satisfy collectors and traditional-art markets with certified ivory, and thus drive down demand for poached tusks. Technological advances such as DNA tracking and microchipping make it possible to trace every legally sold piece of ivory from origin to final owner, ensuring transparency and accountability.

Finally, let us confront what is perhaps the most persuasive argument—the moral one. Our end goal should always be the survival of elephants and the well-being of people. To achieve this, we must move beyond idealistic but ineffective bans and embrace pragmatic, evidence-based solutions. By legalizing ivory trade under strictly enforced guidelines, we create incentives that align conservation with economic benefit, transforming elephants from victims of crime into valued assets worth protecting.

In closing, I urge you to see the issue not through the haze of past assumptions, but through the lens of practical success, community empowerment, and scientific management."
52c5cf0f-a909-4ae5-a327-7f97f67fd1ef,We should legalize ivory trade,gpt-4.1,"Ladies and gentlemen, honorable judges, and esteemed opponents,

Today, I stand before you to advocate for a position that, at first glance, may seem controversial, but upon deeper consideration reveals itself to be a pragmatic, ethical, and environmentally sound solution to a crisis we have been unable to resolve for decades. The topic before us is: “We should legalize ivory trade.” I urge you to set aside preconceptions, and consider the real-world impacts, proven historical precedents, and the multifaceted benefits that a legal and regulated ivory trade can bring.

Firstly, let us confront the uncomfortable reality. Despite an outright global ban on ivory trade since 1989, poaching has not stopped. In fact, in several regions, it has become more organized, more violent, and more damaging both to elephant populations and to local communities. According to data from the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species (CITES), illegal ivory trade has fueled vast black markets, controlled by criminal syndicates that thrive precisely because of prohibition. Just as with alcohol in the 1920s or drugs today, prohibition has bred crime, corruption, and chaos. Bans have not saved elephants—they have put their fate in the hands of those least likely to care for their welfare. By contrast, a legal, transparent, and well-regulated trade offers a powerful mechanism to undermine black markets and channel resources towards conservation.

Secondly, we must recognize the profound conservation potential of legal ivory sales. Countries like Botswana, Namibia, Zimbabwe, and South Africa have demonstrated in the past that they can sustainably manage elephant populations and ivory stocks. For example, the 1999 and 2008 one-off sales of legal, registered ivory resulted in much-needed revenue that was specifically allocated for anti-poaching initiatives, habitat restoration, and community development. It is not a coincidence that the countries that lobbied for such sales are also those best known for successful wildlife management. Controlled sales generate funds for the very programs that protect elephants, while bans leave parks underfunded and rangers outgunned. Additionally, these sales were tightly monitored and had no measurable impact on poaching levels at the time, according to multiple independent studies. Regulation brings accountability, whereas bans breed shadows where criminals thrive.

Thirdly, consider the perspective and rights of the people who live alongside elephants. For millions of rural Africans, elephants are not merely icons or ethical abstractions—they are sometimes dangerous, destructive forces. Crop-raiding, injuries, and even deaths are part of daily life for communities in elephant range countries. Yet these same communities stand to benefit directly from sustainable ivory trade. Ivory is not only derived from poaching—it can be legally and humanely sourced from elephants that die of natural causes, “problem” elephants that threaten human life, or from managed population interventions. In a legal trade system, local people gain a tangible economic stake in elephant conservation. Such community incentives have been shown to reduce both poaching and human-elephant conflict, transforming elephants from burdens into valued resources.

We must also recognize that the demand for ivory will not simply disappear. Centuries of cultural tradition, craftsmanship, and artistry in many Asian and African societies cannot be erased by decree. If we acknowledge this demand, we can channel and moderate it through licensing, tracking, quotas, and biometric marking—tools that are now readily available thanks to modern science. This is not a call for reckless exploitation, but for measured, adaptive, and science-based management. 

Ladies and gentlemen, the facts are clear. The ban strategy is failing elephants, failing communities, and fueling crime."
c487b1a0-b44b-4fd3-bef9-1447e4ba1e2f,We should legalize organ trade,gpt-4.1,"Honourable judges, esteemed opponents, and valued audience,

Today, we stand before you to advocate a motion as urgent as it is controversial: We should legalize organ trade. At first glance, the notion of commodifying human organs may stir unease. Yet, upon closer examination, we find compelling moral, practical, and humanitarian reasons to support the legalization of organ trade. Let us look past stigma and emotion, and confront the profound suffering caused by the status quo.

Every year, tens of thousands of people languish and die on organ transplant waitlists worldwide. According to the World Health Organization, less than 10% of global organ needs are met through legal, altruistic donation programs. In the United States alone, over 100,000 individuals await organs; on average, 17 die every single day waiting, their hope extinguished by organ shortages. The truth is undeniable: altruism alone is not enough.

Let us consider three key arguments.

First, legalizing organ trade can save thousands of lives by addressing the acute shortage of transplantable organs. The black market in organs already exists, thriving in the shadows where the vulnerable are exploited, and no legal protections exist. By bringing this trade into the light, we can create a transparent, regulated, and ethical system. Instead of desperate recipients turning to traffickers, organs can be matched safely and fairly, maximizing successful outcomes and minimizing suffering.

Second, legalization empowers and protects the poor, rather than exploiting them. Critics argue that only the desperate would sell their organs. But this ignores reality: desperate people are already selling, only in unsafe, unregulated conditions where middlemen extract most of the profit, and follow-up care is non-existent. By legalizing and regulating, we ensure sellers receive proper counseling, fair compensation, medical care, and legal protection—including the right to informed consent and the right to change their minds. Surveys in countries like Iran—where government-regulated kidney sales have been permitted for decades—show that donor outcomes are better and exploitation is minimized compared to black-market settings.

Third, legalization advances autonomy and respects human dignity. The core of bodily autonomy is the right to make decisions about our own bodies. If we can risk our lives as soldiers, donate organs for free, or undergo cosmetic surgery, why should consenting adults be barred from voluntarily providing an organ in exchange for compensation? The current ban in fact forces some to sell organs illegally under dangerous circumstances, or worse, leaves countless patients to die needlessly due to arbitrary moral qualms.

Some may fear that legalizing organ trade will commodify the human body and erode compassion. Yet, does it not already happen—with far graver consequences—under the current clandestine system? Is it not more compassionate to save lives, prevent suffering, and enable empowered, informed individuals to make choices that benefit both themselves and others? Rather than eroding ethics, legal, regulated organ trade can embody compassion, autonomy, and fairness.

Moreover, regulated organ trade would relieve the immense financial burden on healthcare systems. The cost of years of dialysis far outweighs the cost of transplantation. By increasing supply and reducing wait times, legalized organ trade saves patients, families, and societies vast emotional and economic resources.

In conclusion, the current ban on organ trade is not reducing the trade, but making it criminal, dangerous, and inhumane. Legalization offers a path to transparency, dignity, and, most importantly, hope for those desperately in need. It is not only a practical solution; it is a moral imperative. To continue on our present course is to turn our backs on preventable suffering and needless death.

Honourable judges, the time has come to bravely rethink our approach."
2383c721-d407-4a26-88ec-776a5e5d62bc,We should legalize organ trade,gpt-4.1,"Honorable judges, esteemed opponents, and respected audience,

Today, we stand at the crossroads of morality, necessity, and pragmatism as we debate an urgent and transformative proposal: that we should legalize the trade of human organs.

Every ten minutes, a new name is added to organ transplant waiting lists around the world. Every hour, thousands suffer, and far too many die because a lifesaving organ does not arrive in time. In my speech, I will advance three critical pillars explaining why legalizing organ trade is not only justifiable but imperative: the alleviation of needless suffering, the elimination of the black market, and the promotion of bodily autonomy.

First, legalizing organ trade will save lives and end needless suffering. According to the World Health Organization, there is a catastrophic and chronic shortfall between the organs needed and those donated. Last year alone, in the United States, over 6,000 people died waiting for transplants; globally, this number reaches tens of thousands. Voluntary donation, though noble, simply cannot satisfy the demand. Legalization, with appropriate regulation, can incentivize more donors, bridging the gaping chasm between supply and demand. We have precedents: the Iranian model, where regulated kidney sales have virtually eliminated waiting lists—every patient who needs a kidney receives one. This isn’t theoretical—it’s reality, and it is saving lives.

Second, legalizing and regulating the organ trade would strike a mortal blow to the black market. Today’s prohibition does not prevent sales; it shoves them underground, fostering a multi-billion dollar international market rife with exploitation. Vulnerable populations are trafficked, conned, and coerced; patients die from poor surgical standards and lack of oversight. Prohibition not only fails to protect the vulnerable, it directly endangers them. By legalizing organ trade, we can impose strict regulations, ensure proper medical protocols, and protect all parties: the donor, the recipient, and society at large. Transparency and legality convert an unregulated market of exploitation into one of safety, dignity, and accountability.

Third, the legalization of organ trade is an expression of bodily autonomy—a fundamental human right. People should have the power to make informed decisions about their own bodies, including the choice to sell an organ if they so desire. This is not about coercion or compulsion; this is about recognizing the agency of individuals, especially the poor, to better their lives. Denial of this right paternalizes citizens, reducing them to the status of children unable to make meaningful decisions. Let us remember: we allow people to take far greater risks for compensation in other domains—soldiers, firefighters, miners, all gamble with their health and welfare for economic gain, and society rightly honors and supports their choices.

But I hear concerns—about exploitation, commodification, and fairness. Let me be clear: the answer is not prohibition but careful regulation. Set robust safeguards: informed consent, psychological evaluation, anti-coercion protocols, and equitable compensation. Build comprehensive post-donation healthcare into every transaction. Make it illegal for brokers to operate, and ensure only medically and ethically qualified teams are involved. In such a system, the horror stories of forced or unsafe organ removal wither away, replaced by stories of lives saved and dignity preserved.

Ultimately, legalization is not about putting a “price tag” on life—it is about valuing life enough to do what is necessary to save it. Let’s face facts, not hysteria; let’s look past dogma to outcomes that matter. The status quo is not working. Lives are lost. Suffering abounds. The black market booms."
87163c6a-5849-4964-9881-76615cc47ebc,Surrogacy should be banned,gpt-4.1,"Ladies and gentlemen, esteemed judges, honorable opponents, thank you for this opportunity to present the affirmative case on the vital and pressing topic: ""Should surrogacy be banned?"" We firmly assert that surrogacy should indeed be banned, due to the violations it poses to ethical standards, the exploitative nature inherent in its practice, and the potential harm inflicted on all parties involved, especially women and children. Allow me to elaborate.

First and foremost, surrogacy reduces the miracle of childbirth—a deeply personal and natural process—into a mere commercial transaction. While proponents argue that it is an act of altruism, the reality is far from ideal. In almost every jurisdiction where commercial surrogacy is practiced, it is primarily the economically disadvantaged women who become surrogates, catering to wealthy individuals or couples. This creates a profound imbalance: the bodies of the vulnerable are rented to fulfill the desires of the privileged. This, I contend, is exploitation in its most insidious form, as it takes advantage of financial desperation and forces women to commodify their reproductive capacities.

Secondly, surrogacy fundamentally undermines the dignity and autonomy of women. Throughout history, women have fought long and hard to reclaim agency over their bodies. Surrogacy threatens to undo these gains by turning the womb into a tool for hire, a service to be bought and sold. Women who act as surrogates—even under so-called ""informed consent""—do so within a system shaped by power imbalances and economic coercion. Can we, as a society, truly say that a choice made under duress or severe financial need is a genuine choice? By legalizing or normalizing surrogacy, we set a dangerous precedent that a woman’s body is an object for use, regulated by contract and subject to third-party demands. The implication is clear: women's bodies become business ventures, rather than the sacred vessels of potential life.

In addition to the exploitation of women, surrogacy raises profound ethical concerns about the commodification of children. Surrogacy treats children not as individuals born of mutual love and natural process, but as end products of a business agreement. The deliberate separation of a newborn baby from their birth mother at the moment of birth disregards the emotional and psychological well-being of both the child and the surrogate mother. Recent research in child psychology suggests that early separation from the birth mother can have lasting impacts on a child’s attachment and development. Are we prepared to ignore these warnings for the sake of consumer demands?

Moreover, the transmission of parental rights and responsibilities through contracts, rather than natural bonds, opens a Pandora's box of legal and moral dilemmas. Consider the countless cases worldwide where surrogacy arrangements have resulted in bitter disputes about custody, citizenship, and abandonment. When intended parents back out, or when surrogate mothers feel emotionally unable to part with the child they carried, who suffers? Innocent children. By banning surrogacy, we sidestep these messy, traumatic disputes and protect the rights and well-being of the most vulnerable.

It is also crucial to acknowledge that alternative methods—such as adoption—exist for those yearning for parenthood. Adoption serves dual social functions: it provides loving homes for children already in need, and it does not commercialize the act of birth or the female body. By prioritizing adoption over surrogacy, we reinforce societal values of care, altruism, and non-exploitation.

In conclusion, the continued legalization of surrogacy perpetuates cycles of exploitation, commodifies both women and children, and raises deep and persistent ethical dilemmas."
7e5a8019-db4c-4235-b457-a3917a14a978,Surrogacy should be banned,gpt-4.1,"Ladies and gentlemen, honorable judges, esteemed opponents, and respected audience, today I stand before you to support the motion that surrogacy should be banned.

Surrogacy, the process by which a woman carries and gives birth to a child for another individual or couple, is a practice that has ignited passionate debate worldwide. While often framed as a charitable act or a route to parenthood for those unable to conceive, the reality is that surrogacy, in all its forms—whether commercial or altruistic—raises significant ethical, legal, and social concerns that cannot be ignored. It is these concerns that make a total ban not only justified but imperative.

First, let us address the most fundamental issue: the commodification and exploitation of women. At its core, surrogacy turns the miracle of childbirth into a commercial transaction. Women, often of lower socio-economic status, are recruited or pressured into becoming surrogates, not as an act of selfless altruism, but due to financial desperation. These women are reduced to mere vessels—wombs for rent—in a marketplace that monetizes and objectifies their bodies. Numerous studies and human rights reports, including those from the United Nations, highlight the exploitation and abuse of surrogate mothers, particularly in countries with lax regulation or in economically disadvantaged regions. This is not empowerment; this is a modern form of reproductive slavery, and no amount of financial compensation can justify the violation of human dignity.

Secondly, surrogacy poses serious risks to the health and well-being of surrogate mothers. Pregnancy and childbirth come with inherent medical risks: from gestational diabetes to life-threatening complications like preeclampsia and hemorrhage. In commercial surrogacy, the priority is often not the surrogate's health, but the successful delivery of a healthy baby to the ""clients."" Studies reveal that surrogates are often subject to invasive medical procedures, multiple embryo implantations, and pressure to undergo unnecessary C-sections, all to maximize the chances of a successful transaction. This utilitarian attitude towards the surrogate's body fundamentally undermines her right to bodily autonomy and health.

Thirdly, consider the legal and psychological dilemmas faced by the children born of surrogacy. These children, from their very inception, are the subjects of contracts—bought, sold, and transferred across borders like commodities in an international marketplace. Disputes over parental rights, citizenship, and custody have left many of these children in legal limbo, stateless and without protection. Moreover, the psychological impact on children who learn they were the product of such transactional arrangements has not been adequately studied, but the potential for confusion, identity crises, and emotional distress is immense.

Furthermore, surrogacy strikes at the very foundations of family and motherhood. It artificially separates the process of conception, pregnancy, and parenting, undermining the deep biological and emotional bonds that naturally arise between a mother and her child. The severing of this bond is not a trivial matter; research in developmental psychology underscores the importance of maternal attachment, and yet surrogacy deliberately and contractually severs it.

Let us not forget the multiple and often unresolvable legal dilemmas. Surrogacy contracts frequently cross national boundaries, leading to a web of conflicting laws, ethical standards, and exploitation of regulatory loopholes. How can we, in good conscience, support a practice that fuels a global black market in babies, rife with fraud, coercion, and heartbreak?

Some may argue that banning surrogacy denies infertile couples the chance to experience parenthood. But two wrongs do not make a right. The legitimate desire for a child cannot take precedence over the rights, health, and dignity of women and children. There are alternative paths—adoption, for example—that do not require the exploitation of another human being."
0555fa74-5aa5-4205-94e4-e4dce0a027f0,We should close the Guantanamo Bay detention camp,gpt-4.1,"Esteemed judges, honored opponents, and respected audience,

Today, I rise to advocate emphatically for the closure of the Guantanamo Bay detention camp. This facility, established more than two decades ago in the name of national security, has instead become a symbol of injustice, a liability for our nation’s standing in the world, and a persistent threat to the very values on which the United States—and indeed, any democracy—stands. It is long past time to close Guantanamo.

Firstly, let us consider the fundamental contradiction at the heart of Guantanamo Bay: the abandonment of core legal principles. Since 2002, hundreds of men have been detained at Guantanamo without charge or trial, denied the most basic legal rights enshrined in both American law and international agreements. The idea that anyone—regardless of allegation, nationality, or circumstance—can be held indefinitely without a fair hearing violates the Constitution and the Geneva Conventions, both of which guarantee due process and humane treatment.

It is not simply a legal formality that is at stake here. The prolonged detention without trial has led to human rights abuses well-documented by watchdogs, journalists, and bipartisan government investigations. Reports of torture, including waterboarding, sleep deprivation, and psychological trauma, are not mere allegations but established facts. These abuses erode our moral authority and provide a narrative for extremist recruitment worldwide. If we are to stand as a beacon for human rights and justice, we cannot continue to allow such a stain to persist under our flag.

Secondly, the failure to prosecute or release those held at Guantanamo undermines the legitimacy and effectiveness of our legal and military systems. America has robust federal courts that have prosecuted hundreds of terrorism-related cases with transparency and fairness. The very existence of Guantanamo implies that our time-tested judicial system is insufficient or inadequate—a notion that is both inaccurate and damaging. Moreover, multiple defense officials, former presidents, and counterterrorism experts have indicated that Guantanamo’s continued operation does not contribute to national security. Instead, it diverts resources, fosters resentment, and distracts from genuine threats.

Economically, Guantanamo Bay is an unconscionable expense for the American taxpayer. As of now, each detainee costs more than $13 million annually to incarcerate. Compare this to the $80,000 it costs, on average, to hold a prisoner in a maximum-security federal prison. This is a stark, indefensible disparity—one that cannot be justified in any era, especially not in times demanding fiscal responsibility.

Internationally, Guantanamo Bay is a diplomatic albatross. It is routinely cited by allies and adversaries alike as evidence that the United States fails to uphold the rights it espouses. It weakens our credibility to criticize human rights abuses if we continue to run a facility synonymous with indefinite detention, torture, and secrecy.

Some will counter that Guantanamo is necessary to house “the worst of the worst.” Yet, the majority of detainees have been released without incident; others have been held based only on hearsay or unreliable evidence. The assertion that justice is impossible in federal courts simply does not hold—the conviction record in terror cases proves otherwise.

Closing Guantanamo does not mean releasing dangerous individuals into society. It means restoring the rule of law—either by charging detainees and providing them with fair trials in federal or military courts or by resettling those found to pose no credible threat. This is not a utopian vision; it is a practical imperative supported by military leaders, human rights advocates, and bipartisan coalitions."
f52dba67-39ed-4379-8c46-8b62580fb511,We should close the Guantanamo Bay detention camp,gpt-4.1,"Honourable judges, esteemed opponents, and valued audience,

Today, we confront a question that not only tests our commitment to justice but challenges us to consider the very values upon which our society stands. The motion before us is clear and urgent: We should close the Guantanamo Bay detention camp. I stand with conviction in support of this motion, not only because it is the right thing to do, but because it is the pragmatic, moral, and strategic path forward for our nation and for the international community.

Let us begin by reminding ourselves what Guantanamo Bay represents. Established in 2002, in the wake of the September 11 attacks, Guantanamo has operated as a site for the detention, interrogation, and prosecution of individuals suspected of terrorism. While the intentions that led to its creation may have been grounded in the desire for security, the reality of Guantanamo is a legacy of injustice—a stain on the credibility of the United States and on the broader principles of democracy and human rights.

First and foremost, Guantanamo Bay represents a fundamental violation of human rights. Hundreds of detainees have been held at the camp without formal charges or fair trials, some for decades, in direct contravention of the United States Constitution and the Universal Declaration of Human Rights. Habeas corpus, the most basic legal safeguard against arbitrary detention, has been routinely denied. Torture and inhumane treatment, documented by reputable organizations, have occurred under the cover of secrecy. By keeping Guantanamo open, we send a clear signal to the world: that we are willing to compromise our deepest values in the name of expediency. Is this the message we wish to project?

Some may argue that Guantanamo is necessary for national security. However, the evidence tells a different story. Of the nearly 800 individuals once held at the camp, the majority have been released or transferred, and most never faced charges or formal trials. The notion that these indefinite detentions make us safer is not supported by empirical studies; in fact, Guantanamo has become a recruitment tool for extremist groups, who exploit its very existence to fuel anti-American sentiment and inspire terror. By closing Guantanamo, we would remove a potent symbol used by our adversaries to cast doubt on our commitment to justice and the rule of law.

Moreover, Guantanamo's continued operation is exorbitantly expensive and logistically indefensible. The United States spends over $500 million per year to house a few dozen detainees—a staggering sum that far exceeds the costs of maximum-security prisons on U.S. soil. This is not only an irresponsible use of taxpayers’ money; it is a drain on resources that could be better spent on programs that genuinely enhance our security, such as intelligence gathering and counterterrorism partnerships.

Guantanamo also undermines our global standing. As long as it remains open, our advocacy for human rights and the rule of law is compromised; our lectures to other nations on due process and humane treatment are rendered hollow. Closing Guantanamo would restore moral authority, lend credibility to our voice on the international stage, and reaffirm our leadership in upholding the values we champion.

Finally, closing Guantanamo is not an act of leniency toward terrorism—it is a necessary step toward restoring a justice system in which guilt and innocence are determined by evidence, not suspicion or circumstance. Those who are charged with crimes should face fair, transparent, and lawful trials; those who are innocent should not continue to languish in legal limbo.

In conclusion, Guantanamo Bay is a monument to failed policies of the past."
5126aacc-125f-4603-9ff0-b22433e95498,We should further exploit small modular reactors,gpt-4.1,"Honorable judges, esteemed opponents, and respected audience,

Today, I am proud to stand in firm support of the motion: ""We should further exploit small modular reactors."" This topic is not merely one of technological preference; it sits at the very heart of how we will power our societies, protect our planet, and secure a sustainable future for all.

Let us begin by confronting the current reality: the world stands at a crossroads. On one side, we face an escalating climate crisis. Traditional fossil fuels—coal, oil, and natural gas—remain dominant sources of electricity, fueling economic growth but also spewing out carbon emissions that push our planet towards catastrophic warming. On the other side, existing renewable technologies, though advancing rapidly, still struggle to provide reliable, round-the-clock power at the necessary scale—due to intermittency, storage issues, and limited grid infrastructure. 

Herein lies the transformative promise of small modular reactors, or SMRs. These advanced nuclear generators, designed to be built in factories and shipped to sites for rapid assembly, represent a breakthrough in clean, safe, flexible, and scalable energy.

First and foremost, SMRs can deliver on the urgent need for low-carbon energy. Unlike wind or solar, which are subject to the whims of weather and day-night cycles, SMRs provide steady baseload electricity, twenty-four hours a day. Each SMR emits virtually no greenhouse gases during operation. As we strive to decarbonize our energy systems at pace, only firm, reliable power sources like nuclear can fill the gaps left by intermittent renewables, especially in heavy industry and dense urban centers.

Second, SMRs are far more flexible and adaptable than traditional, large-scale nuclear plants. Standard reactors require enormous upfront investments, decade-long construction projects, and vast tracts of land. By contrast, SMRs are modular—assembled from standardized components, enabling rapid, cost-effective deployment. This means SMRs can be scaled to meet the specific needs of a city, a rural area, or an industrial site. They can be sited where other power sources are not viable, including remote or underserved regions, thus democratizing access to clean energy and promoting economic development.

Safety is often cited as a concern with nuclear technology. But let us be clear: SMRs represent a quantum leap forward in safety and security. Their smaller size, passive safety features, and advanced designs dramatically reduce the risk of accidents or radiation leaks. In many cases, SMRs are engineered such that, in the event of a malfunction, they safely shut down with no need for human intervention or external power—an impossibility with older designs. Moreover, the nuclear industry operates under some of the most stringent regulations and oversight in the world, and SMRs will be no exception.

Economically, SMRs will invigorate industries and foster high-skill jobs. Their modular construction streamlines manufacturing processes, driving down costs over time through economies of scale and learning-by-doing. They can be deployed to replace retiring coal plants—often using existing grid connections—thereby reinvigorating local economies facing decline. And as the world increasingly recognizes the value of secure, domestic energy supply in a volatile geopolitical climate, SMRs provide nations with energy independence, stabilizing costs and insulating societies from price shocks.

To those who say nuclear waste is an insurmountable obstacle, I respond: SMR technologies can be designed to minimize waste, even reusing spent fuel from conventional reactors. And with robust, proven waste storage solutions already in operation globally, the challenges are far from insurmountable.

In conclusion, the need for clean, reliable, and flexible energy has never been more pressing. Small modular reactors unlock the potential to meet our climate goals, drive economic growth, and electrify the future—safely and securely."
76cc70ad-59d5-4c72-a11d-ba49686c40a2,We should further exploit small modular reactors,gpt-4.1,"Honorable judges, esteemed opponents, and respected audience,

Today, we stand at a crossroads in the future of global energy—a future shaped by our choices, our innovations, and our collective will to secure a better tomorrow. The motion before us is compelling and urgent: ""We should further exploit small modular reactors."" I am here to affirm this motion, demonstrating that investing in and deploying small modular reactors—SMRs—is not merely an option, but a necessity for our sustainable future.

Let us begin with the reality of our global energy landscape. The world’s demand for clean, reliable, and affordable electricity is projected to soar by 50% or more in the coming decades. Meanwhile, we face an existential imperative: to decarbonize our economies and stem the tide of catastrophic climate change. Existing renewable energy sources—wind, solar, hydro—are indispensable but inherently intermittent and regionally constrained. Energy storage technologies, while promising, remain costly and underdeveloped at scale.

Here lies the unique promise of small modular reactors. SMRs are advanced nuclear reactors, significantly smaller in size compared to traditional nuclear plants, and designed for modularity, flexibility, and enhanced safety. They represent a leap forward in energy innovation, offering solutions to the pressing challenges that conventional systems cannot easily address.

Firstly, SMRs provide carbon-free, baseload energy. Unlike coal or natural gas plants, SMRs emit zero greenhouse gases during operation. Unlike solar or wind, they are not hostage to weather or daylight. This makes them uniquely capable of providing round-the-clock electricity essential for hospitals, factories, and growing urban populations. If we are serious about our climate commitments, we must deploy every tool available, and SMRs are among the most potent.

Secondly, SMRs offer transformative flexibility and scalability. Traditional nuclear reactors demand billions in upfront investment and are often beset by years of construction delays. In contrast, SMRs can be factory-built, shipped to site, and installed in a fraction of the time and at reduced cost. Their modular nature allows energy planners to add units as demand grows or technology evolves, minimizing financial risk—a key incentive for both public and private stakeholders.

Thirdly, SMRs enhance safety. Modern designs incorporate passive safety features, significantly reducing the risk of accidents. Many SMRs are built underground, further shielding them from natural disasters or outside threats. Their reduced fuel load and innovative cooling systems make SMRs less vulnerable to the types of catastrophic failure that haunt the public imagination. In fact, some designs can use spent nuclear fuel, turning waste into a resource and further reducing environmental impact.

Fourth, SMRs offer unprecedented opportunities for energy equity and security. Today, over 700 million people live without electricity. Remote communities, island nations, and industrial hubs often struggle to access consistent power. The small footprint and portability of SMRs make them uniquely suitable for off-grid or hard-to-reach areas, serving as lifelines for economic development and human well-being.

The economic benefits, too, are substantial. Expanding the SMR industry fosters innovation, creates highly skilled jobs, revitalizes manufacturing, and strengthens the backbone of national economies. It is no surprise that countries from Canada to China, from Sweden to the United States, are racing to develop and export SMR technology—a global market opportunity estimated at hundreds of billions of dollars.

It is important to acknowledge concerns regarding nuclear proliferation, waste, and cost. Yet these can be addressed through robust international oversight, continued technological advancements, and transparent governance. The risks of inaction—runaway carbon emissions, energy shortages, economic stagnation—are manifestly greater.

In conclusion, the exploitation of small modular reactors is not an embrace of past mistakes, but a bold stride into a cleaner, safer, and more equitable energy future."
adca79b8-8959-4e03-aafd-c75d20ea093c,We should adopt a zero tolerance policy in schools,gpt-4.1,"Ladies and gentlemen, esteemed judges, honorable opponents, and valued members of the audience: Today, I rise to affirm the motion that we should adopt a zero tolerance policy in schools. This proposition is not merely about rules or punishments; it is about affirming the foundational values of safety, respect, and equity that should govern all learning environments.

First, let us clarify what a zero tolerance policy entails. A zero tolerance policy mandates strict, predetermined consequences—typically suspension or expulsion—for specific, clearly defined infractions such as violence, drugs, weapons, or severe bullying. Critics argue this approach is inflexible, but let us be clear: zero tolerance is not a mindless quest for punishment, but a necessary stance to guarantee the safety, security, and fairness that all students deserve.

Let us begin with the paramount concern: safety. Every parent entrusts their child to a school with the fundamental expectation that their welfare will not be compromised. However, the unfortunate reality is that violence, bullying, and the presence of drugs or weapons in schools are ongoing threats. In 2022, the National Center for Education Statistics reported over 900,000 incidents of violence, theft, or other crimes in American public schools alone. Each of these is not just a statistic, but a failing on our part to protect the vulnerable.

A zero tolerance policy establishes a clear line in the sand. It unequivocally communicates that violence, drugs, and weapons will not be tolerated—ever. This clarity deters dangerous behavior before it happens. When the consequences are automatic and evenly enforced, potential violators are forced to weigh the certainty of punishment against fleeting impulses. Evidence from districts adopting zero tolerance for weapons has demonstrated a measurable drop in incidences of armed violence and, more importantly, a greater sense of security among students and staff. There is no ambiguity or mixed messaging: dangerous behavior will have real consequences, every time.

Second, the power of consistency cannot be underestimated. One of the strongest arguments for zero tolerance is that it eliminates arbitrary or biased disciplinary decisions. Too often, in schools without such policies, discipline is subject to inconsistent enforcement, influenced perhaps unintentionally by conscious or unconscious bias—whether based on race, class, or other factors. Zero tolerance introduces predictability and accountability into the system. Everyone knows the rules; everyone knows the consequences. By providing a transparent framework, zero tolerance promotes equity in disciplinary actions and ensures that all students are treated the same, regardless of background.

Third, zero tolerance protects not only individuals but the school environment as a whole. Learning cannot flourish in chaos. The presence of drugs, bullying, or violence sends the harmful message that such transgressions can be ignored or minimized. This fosters a culture of fear, not of learning. On the contrary, a strict, zero tolerance policy upholds the message that the well-being and education of the majority are valued above the disruptive or dangerous actions of a few. Teachers can teach and students can learn only when the environment is safe, predictable, and respectful.

Of course, some argue that zero tolerance is too harsh, that it doesn’t consider the whole child, or allow for unique circumstances. But let us not conflate mercy with permissiveness. Exceptions and endless “second chances” ultimately send the wrong signal: that boundaries are flexible and safety is negotiable. By adopting clear policies and ensuring all students and parents understand them, we provide fair warning, not arbitrary punishment.

In summary, a zero tolerance policy is a rational, responsible, and ethical approach to ensuring our schools are safe, equitable sanctuaries for learning."
c90ba12f-da2d-48cd-bee5-bcc597b56f95,We should adopt a zero tolerance policy in schools,gpt-4.1,"Honorable judges, esteemed opponents, and respected audience,

Today I stand before you to advocate for a measure that promises safety, fairness, and a brighter future for all our students: adopting a zero tolerance policy in schools. This policy, at its core, asserts that certain behaviors—violence, bullying, possession of weapons or drugs—will not be tolerated under any circumstances, and that clear, predetermined consequences will be enforced when violations occur.

Let me be clear: the goal of zero tolerance is not to criminalize or ostracize students, but to establish schools as safe sanctuaries of learning where every child has the right to pursue an education free from fear, threat, or disruption. In a time where headlines frequently highlight tragedies and escalating behavioral issues within our schools, the need for decisive action has never been more urgent.

First and foremost, zero tolerance policies deter dangerous and disruptive behaviors. When students know that infractions such as bullying, weapon possession, or drug use will have undeniable consequences, they are far less likely to commit these offenses. Imagine the impact: a dramatic decline in the bullying epidemic that plagues so many of our children; a drop in on-campus violence; and a reduction in the presence of drugs and dangerous contraband. By clearly outlining which actions are unacceptable and backing those rules with unwavering enforcement, we send a message that we place the safety and well-being of our students and staff above all else.

Secondly, zero tolerance ensures fairness and impartiality. Too often, school disciplinary procedures are plagued by inconsistency. Bias—conscious or unconscious—can influence the punishments handed out to students. Studies show that minority and marginalized students are especially vulnerable to subjective discipline decisions. With zero tolerance, there is little room for personal prejudice or ambiguity—the rules apply equally to everyone. This uniformity helps to restore faith in the system, increase transparency, and foster an environment where students and parents alike understand the expectations and consequences clearly.

Let us also consider the long-term benefits to the educational environment itself. Research demonstrates that schools with firm, consistently enforced behavior policies experience fewer disruptions and a greater sense of safety among students and faculty. Such environments empower teachers to focus on instruction rather than discipline, raising academic attainment and allowing all students to thrive. The presence of a zero tolerance policy sends a clear sign: this is a place for learning, and any conduct that threatens that mission will not be entertained.

Of course, critics argue that zero tolerance policies strip schools of nuance and compassion. But in reality, creating clear, non-negotiable boundaries for the most serious offenses does not mean we ignore restorative practices or support systems for students. Rather, it ensures that the most egregious actions—those which genuinely endanger or traumatize others—receive the decisive response they deserve. Meanwhile, lesser infractions can still be addressed with counseling, mentorship, and intervention. Zero tolerance is not about punishing minor mistakes; it's about drawing a line in the sand against the gravest threats to our community.

Let us also remember our duty to those who have been victims—students whose voices are too often lost amid discussions of leniency. Each act of unchecked bullying, every weapon brought to campus, every instance of drug use ignored, sends a signal that their safety is negotiable. A zero tolerance policy tells victims: ""We hear you. We value you. We will protect you.""

In closing, adopting a zero tolerance policy in our schools is not an overreaction; it is a necessary commitment to safety, justice, and academic excellence."
90325b8a-8dcf-4d3e-9fff-ed2a81283723,We should ban homeopathy,gpt-4.1,"Ladies and gentlemen, esteemed judges, and fellow debaters,

Today we stand at a crucial intersection where science, public health, and ethical responsibility meet. The motion before us is clear and pressing: “We should ban homeopathy.” I stand firmly in support of this proposition. In these next few minutes, I will outline three core reasons why a ban on homeopathy isn’t just justified—it is necessary for the protection of our collective health, the preservation of scientific integrity, and the ethical stewardship of vulnerable populations.

First, let’s address the scientific reality: Homeopathy simply does not work. Founded in the late 18th century by Samuel Hahnemann, homeopathy is rooted in the unproven ideas of “like cures like” and “ultra-dilution”—the belief that substances become more potent the more they are diluted, often beyond the point at which any molecules of the original substance remain. Over more than two centuries, despite tremendous advances in medical science, homeopathy has failed to demonstrate efficacy beyond that of a placebo. Competent, large-scale evaluations, including those conducted by the National Health and Medical Research Council of Australia and systematic reviews published in reputable journals, have repeatedly found no reliable evidence that homeopathic treatments have any effect above placebo for any clinical condition. To allow a therapy that science repeatedly debunks is to mislead the public, waste valuable resources, and license pseudoscience at personal and societal levels.

Second, allowing homeopathy is a public health risk. Every day, people rely on homeopathic remedies to treat serious illnesses—from asthma to cancer to childhood infections—and delay or forgo evidence-based medical treatment. This isn’t a hypothetical risk; documented cases abound where individuals have suffered, or even died, because they trusted homeopathy over proven medicine. Moreover, the normalization of homeopathy undermines trust in the healthcare system and sows confusion: if some remedies work, despite being chemically indistinct from water or sugar, why trust science at all? In the midst of epidemics, public health emergencies, or rising vaccine hesitancy, blurring the lines between evidence-based and unproven therapies is simply dangerous. When governments or pharmacies legitimize homeopathy by selling these products on their shelves, they endorse a false equivalence between real medicine and magical thinking. The result is not harmless; it is increased suffering, unnecessary expense, and preventable death.

Third, there is a matter of ethics and justice. The continued sale and promotion of homeopathy preys on the vulnerable: those desperately seeking hope, those with chronic or incurable diseases, those confused by complex scientific information. The burden often falls hardest on those with less access to education or conventional healthcare. Homeopathy, through suggestive marketing and anecdotal testimonials, exploits their need for relief, offering little but false hope and empty promises. It is fundamentally unethical to offer a placebo in place of real care, particularly under the guise of medical legitimacy. We must ask ourselves: Is it just to stand by while individuals—sometimes children—are misled into thinking they are receiving medicine, when they are receiving nothing of substance at all?

Our motion is not merely a question of preference or belief. It is a test of our commitment to science, to public welfare, and to ethical practice. To argue against banning homeopathy is to accept, tacitly or otherwise, that we are willing to tolerate pseudoscience in our pharmacies, confusion in our medical culture, and exploitation in our homes.

In conclusion: Homeopathy has no scientific merit. Its continued acceptance is a liability to our health systems, our public safety, and our moral standards."
38a26378-5296-4ccf-8317-951ae457eb2f,We should ban homeopathy,gpt-4.1,"Honourable judges, esteemed opponents, and respected audience,

Today, we stand before you to make the decisive case for banning homeopathy. This is not merely a debate about personal choice but a profound matter of public health, scientific integrity, and societal wellbeing. Homeopathy is not a harmless alternative—it is, as I will demonstrate, a dangerous pseudoscience that diverts individuals from effective treatments, endangers lives, wastes precious resources, and undermines trust in real medicine.

First, we must be clear about what homeopathy is. Developed over two centuries ago, homeopathy claims that diseases can be treated with substances that cause similar symptoms in healthy people, diluted so extremely that often not a single molecule of the original substance remains. Its foundational concepts—including “like cures like” and the “memory of water”—fly in the face of everything we know from biology, chemistry, and physics. Systematic reviews, such as those conducted by the Australian National Health and Medical Research Council and the UK House of Commons Science and Technology Committee, have concluded unequivocally: homeopathic remedies perform no better than placebos.

Some may argue that people should be free to pursue the health regimens they wish. But freedom cannot be construed as license to peddle false hope or fraudulent remedies. Let us consider the grave consequences:

Firstly, patients who turn to homeopathy frequently do so at the expense of evidence-based treatments. The World Health Organization has noted cases in which individuals have chosen homeopathy over vaccines or antimalarial drugs—choices that have resulted in preventable deaths. According to a 2015 study in “The Lancet,” reliance on homeopathic treatments for serious conditions, such as malaria, cancer, or HIV/AIDS, delays proper medical intervention and leads to needless suffering and loss of life. The harm is real and documented; it cannot be excused as “just placebo.”

Secondly, homeopathy drains public resources. In several countries, taxpayer money has subsidized homeopathic treatments—despite a complete lack of clinical efficacy. The UK National Health Service spent millions annually on homeopathic offerings before finally moving to defund them in 2017. Every pound or dollar directed toward homeopathy is one diverted from genuine medical research, critical care, and vital public health programs. In an era stretched by pandemics and healthcare crises, can we afford to squander resources on remedies proven ineffective?

Thirdly, the existence and availability of homeopathy erodes public trust in legitimate medicine. By presenting homeopathic products on pharmacy shelves alongside scientifically-validated treatments, we blur the lines between real medicine and pseudoscience. This confusion is not benign—it feeds into a wider culture of medical misinformation, fuels anti-vaccination sentiments, and deepens scepticism about public health advice. To tolerate homeopathy is to tacitly endorse untruth at the expense of science and reason.

Finally, a ban is the only effective remedy. Mere regulation or labelling has failed to prevent harm. The European Academies Science Advisory Council, representing dozens of national science academies, has called for comprehensively banning homeopathy as a public health imperative. Bans on homeopathic remedies—as enacted in some countries—have led to clearer, safer, and more credible healthcare systems.

Our commitment should be to evidence, safety, and integrity. Homeopathy, by every honest measure, represents none of these. It is an obsolete doctrine that puts lives at risk, wastes money, and undermines the very foundation of modern medicine.

In conclusion, we are not here to debate whether people should have access to “harmless” choices, but to affirm our duty to protect the public from dangerous deception."
03cb5372-d83c-4acc-ac3f-a6854c5dd9ad,We should protect whistleblowers,gpt-4.1,"Honourable judges, esteemed opponents, and respected audience,

Today, I proudly stand in affirmative support of the motion: ""We should protect whistleblowers."" In a world where integrity and transparency are the lifeblood of thriving institutions, we must recognize the vital role that whistleblowers play in defending societal values and upholding justice. Protecting these courageous individuals is not simply a matter of kindness—it is a fundamental necessity for the health of democratic societies, the rule of law, and the collective good.

To begin, let us clarify who whistleblowers are and what they do. Whistleblowers are individuals who, driven by conscience, expose unethical, illegal, or harmful practices occurring within organizations—be they governments, corporations, or other entities. Often acting at great personal risk, they step forward not for personal gain, but out of a duty to the truth and the broader public. History teaches us that whistleblowers have been catalysts for exposing corruption, fraud, environmental crimes, public safety hazards, and abuses of power worldwide.

Yet, for their bravery, whistleblowers too often face retaliation—loss of employment, blacklisting, ruined reputations, financial hardship, and even physical threat. When we fail to protect whistleblowers, we not only punish the messenger, but we also send a dangerous message: that silence is safer than integrity. In allowing whistleblowers to become martyrs rather than defenders of justice, we foster a climate of fear, secrecy, and impunity.

First, let’s consider the immense public benefit whistleblowers provide. From uncovering government misconduct—such as spying on citizens or the concealment of war crimes—to exposing corporate malfeasance like deadly product defects or environmental pollution, whistleblowers have repeatedly averted disasters, protected lives, and saved billions in public funds. The exposure of the Enron scandal, the revelations by Edward Snowden, and the case of Dr. Li Wenliang during the initial stages of COVID-19 in China—each of these whistleblowers revealed crucial truths that would otherwise have remained hidden, at great personal cost. Society is safer, more ethical, and more resilient because people are willing to speak out.

Second, protecting whistleblowers actively deters wrongdoing. When organizational insiders know there are secure, protected channels for reporting abuses—and that those who come forward will not be sacrificed—it creates a powerful disincentive for unethical behavior. Fear of exposure is one of the most effective checks on power and privilege. On the contrary, when whistleblowers are punished without recourse, it emboldens wrongdoers, encourages institutional cover-ups, and perpetuates cycles of corruption.

Third, protecting whistleblowers is a moral imperative closely linked to our shared values of justice and human rights. The Universal Declaration of Human Rights affirms our right to freedom of expression and to seek, receive, and impart information. Those who speak truth to power, particularly in the public interest, embody these principles in action. When we shield whistleblowers from persecution, we uphold the very foundations of democracy and human dignity.

Of course, we must recognize the concerns regarding bad-faith actors or the potential misuse of whistleblowing protections. But these concerns can be addressed through carefully crafted laws and due process—such as filtering frivolous claims and verifying evidence—without dismantling the core of necessary protection for genuine whistleblowers.

In closing, protecting whistleblowers is indispensable to accountable government, ethical business, and the ongoing fight against injustice. Their courage illuminates dark corners, inspires reform, and empowers every one of us to demand better from our institutions. If we wish for a more honest, fair, and just world, we must send a clear and unwavering message: those who speak truth for the public good will not stand alone. We must protect whistleblowers.

Thank you."
8abbf80a-21cd-4e1e-9a08-5713e133ccbd,We should protect whistleblowers,gpt-4.1,"Honorable judges, esteemed opponents, and respected audience, good evening.

Today, I stand in firm affirmation of the motion: “We should protect whistleblowers.” This is not simply a matter of individual ethics or isolated cases; it is a stance that strikes at the very heart of justice, democracy, and the rule of law. In the next few minutes, I will lay out clearly why protecting whistleblowers is not only desirable, but absolutely essential—for our organizations, our governments, and society as a whole.

First, let us clarify what we mean by “whistleblowers.” A whistleblower is an individual who exposes information or activities within a private, public, or governmental organization that are deemed illegal, unethical, or not correct. Often, these individuals report wrongdoing that would otherwise remain hidden. The crucial role they play is that of a courageous messenger who lifts the veil on wrongdoing—sometimes at extraordinary personal cost.

So, the central question is: Why should we protect them?

Let’s begin with the undeniable societal value of whistleblowing. Whistleblowers are often at the frontline against corruption, fraud, safety violations, and the abuse of power. Recent history is replete with powerful examples: Consider the exposure of massive financial frauds like Enron or the Volkswagen emissions scandal. In both cases, whistleblowers brought forward information that protected investors, consumers, and the environment from ongoing harm. In the pharmaceutical industry, whistleblowers have exposed dangerous drugs or unethical marketing practices, saving lives and holding corporations accountable.

These are not isolated incidents—they are indicative of a broader truth: Without whistleblowers, many forms of wrongdoing would persist in the shadows, harming countless people. This foundational point leads to my first argument: 

**1. Whistleblowers are essential to ensuring accountability and transparency.** 

When institutions, whether governmental or corporate, are left unmonitored from within, the temptation to cut corners, conceal mistakes, or commit malfeasance grows ever stronger. External audits and regulations can only go so far. Insiders—employees, contractors, civil servants—are often the only ones who have access to evidence of serious misconduct. By protecting whistleblowers, we create a culture where truth can emerge, wrongdoing can be confronted, and ethical behavior is rewarded rather than punished.

We must also acknowledge the immense risk whistleblowers take. Retaliation can be swift and severe: job loss, blacklisting, legal harassment, or worse. Without robust protection, the cost of coming forward can be career-ending, financially devastating, and emotionally traumatizing. The result: Silence. Wrongdoing festers. Our collective interests suffer.

This brings me to my second argument:

**2. Protecting whistleblowers safeguards the public interest and deters future wrongdoing.**

When potential whistleblowers see strong protections in place—legal safeguards, anti-retaliation statutes, confidentiality measures—they are more likely to step forward when they encounter wrongdoing. This deterrent effect doesn’t just catch crimes after the fact: it sends a powerful signal to would-be wrongdoers that deceit and corruption will not go unnoticed. The presence of protection, then, is not merely defensive; it is preventive.

Finally, let us consider the broader social contract and the health of our democracy. 

**3. Protecting whistleblowers reinforces democratic values and trust in institutions.** 

In democratic societies, power must be answerable to the people. If those who expose abuse are silenced or punished, we undermine faith in our institutions and erode civil liberties. On the contrary, when we honor and protect whistleblowers, we demonstrate our commitment to transparency, justice, and progress.

In conclusion, to protect whistleblowers is to protect ourselves—our rights, our resources, and our future. The message is simple: No one should be punished for telling the truth."
2365fdeb-d246-4d6e-bc8a-a9298e59d8d0,We should disband UNESCO,gpt-4.1,"Honorable judges, esteemed opponents, and respected audience,

Today, we stand to affirm the motion: ""We should disband UNESCO."" This may, at first glance, seem a radical proposition. UNESCO—the United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization—evokes notions of global goodwill, the championing of culture, and the advancement of education. But beneath the veneer of noble intent, UNESCO has become an outdated, ineffective, and even counterproductive organization. It is high time we disband UNESCO for three primary reasons: inefficiency and mission drift, egregious politicization, and the opportunity for superior alternatives.

First, UNESCO is a paragon of inefficiency and mission drift. Established in 1945, UNESCO’s grand mandate was to build peace through education, science, and culture. Yet today, its resources are stretched across a sprawling, unfocused array of 64 sectors and subcommittees. Instead of targeted impact, we see duplication, confusion, and bureaucratic inertia. UNESCO’s flagship World Heritage program, rather than protecting global sites, has become mired in controversy—prioritizing quantity over quality and failing to secure adequate funding or protection. Reports abound of poorly-managed projects, funds not reaching their intended beneficiaries, delays measured in years, and an overreliance on ceremonial declarations over real action. The organization spends as much, or more, on administration as on substantive outcomes. In an era demanding agility, accountability, and proven impact, UNESCO is failing by its own metrics.

Second, UNESCO is hopelessly politicized and has repeatedly demonstrated that it cannot operate above the political fray. The organization has become a stage for international rivalries, voting blocs, and nationalist agendas. Critical decisions—such as World Heritage Site designations—often hinge not on cultural merit or global significance, but on backroom deals and tit-for-tat negotiations among member states. The result is the trivialization of cultural diplomacy, and a body whose pronouncements are frequently ignored or dismissed as tools of statecraft. Key funding nations such as the United States and Israel have withdrawn in protest of persistent bias and politicization, citing examples of blatant unbalance—such as the disproportionate number of resolutions targeting specific states, while ignoring similar or worse abuses elsewhere. This fracturing renders UNESCO toothless: it lacks support, credibility, and genuine authority.

Third, and most crucially, the resources and aspirations currently tied up in UNESCO could be far better deployed through alternative means. The modern world has no shortage of highly effective NGOs, specialized agencies, and bilateral initiatives dedicated to education, science, and culture—entities that are more nimble, transparent, and innovative. Rather than propping up a dysfunctional relic, we should be empowering grassroots organizations, universities, and local partnerships that deliver measurable results. Disbanding UNESCO would free up funding and energy, eliminating the massive administrative overhead and opening new channels for direct, accountable international cooperation. Far from abandoning the values UNESCO claims to protect, we would actually be reaffirming them—through investment in truly meaningful, impactful mechanisms, untethered from the politics, bureaucracy, and inefficacy that pervade UNESCO.

Ladies and gentlemen, our commitment to culture, education, and science does not hinge upon the continued existence of UNESCO. In fact, holding onto UNESCO may be an impediment to genuine progress. The world has changed dramatically since 1945. The problems we face—climate emergency, digital education, cultural preservation amid conflict—are urgent and complex. They demand dynamic, results-driven organizations, not the stagnant machinery of a fading international agency.

Therefore, I urge you, in the interests of efficiency, integrity, and global progress, to support the motion: we should disband UNESCO.

Thank you."
20b75887-a495-42cf-99fa-368c2a4424df,We should disband UNESCO,gpt-4.1,"Ladies and gentlemen, honorable judges, esteemed opponents:

Today we confront an important and provocative motion: ""We should disband UNESCO."" This proposal may, at first glance, seem radical. After all, UNESCO – the United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization – touts laudable goals of promoting education, protecting heritage, and fostering global cooperation. Yet, as we stand at the crossroads of a changing world, it is essential to evaluate institutions not by their intentions, but by their impact, their efficiency, and their relevance. In making a compelling case to disband UNESCO, I will demonstrate three main arguments: first, that UNESCO is ineffective and inefficient; second, that its actions frequently undermine its own values and perpetuate a culture of politicization; and third, that better and more focused alternatives exist for achieving the goals UNESCO purports to champion.

Let us begin with effectiveness. UNESCO is a sprawling bureaucracy, hindered by inertia and crippled by chronic underfunding. Despite grand pronouncements, its tangible impact is limited. For example, the organization’s core projects in education—such as the push for universal literacy or global access to schooling—have yielded paltry real-world results compared to their enormous budgets. Reports by oversight bodies, including the United Nations' own Office of Internal Oversight Services, repeatedly cite projects that stall, duplication of work done by other agencies, and wasteful allocation of resources.

Moreover, when UNESCO does make headlines, it is too often for its failures rather than its successes. Educational attainment globally continues to lag, and the protection of cultural sites remains more a matter of international headlines than on-the-ground effectiveness. According to the World Bank, far more improvements in global education result from national programs, bilateral aid, and private organizations, rather than UNESCO’s interventions.

Second, UNESCO has become an arena for political posturing, rather than a forum for impartial international cooperation. Its most visible initiative, the World Heritage List, is marred by allegations of favoritism, politicization, and double standards. Decisions about what qualifies as a ""World Heritage Site"" are routinely swayed by national lobbying, resulting in a list that reflects political alliances, not objective assessment. This politicization undermines the credibility of the very mission UNESCO is tasked with stewarding.

Furthermore, UNESCO’s record on free speech and academic freedom is checkered at best. While it claims to defend cultural and scientific liberty, it counts among its membership countries with notorious human rights abuses, which use their presence in UNESCO as international legitimization. Time and again, the organization abandons its principles for the sake of consensus, rendering its declarations toothless and its defense of human rights superficial.

Third and crucially, disbanding UNESCO does not mean abandoning the vital work of cultural protection, scientific advancement, or education. Instead, ending this obsolete bureaucracy would clear the way for more agile, specialized, and accountable actors—NGOs with geographic expertise, bilateral agreements, and private-public partnerships that are more responsive to local needs and less shackled by international politics. Already, independent organizations protect cultural heritage in warzones; private initiatives and national programs drive real improvements in schools. Disbanding UNESCO necessitates the redistribution of its resources to more dynamic, transparent, and flexible entities.

Ladies and gentlemen, it is time for a new paradigm. We can—and we must—pursue the ideals of education, science, and culture with more rigor, humility, and effectiveness. An institution mired in inefficiency, compromised by double standards, and increasingly obsolete, cannot serve as the backbone of this effort."
f2c226e3-cfd3-41ef-8bf8-a59fd3bf8a86,We should abolish intelligence tests,gpt-4.1,"Ladies and gentlemen, esteemed judges, honorable opponents, today I stand before you to firmly advocate for the abolition of intelligence tests. The proposition is clear: We should abolish intelligence tests. The reasons for this are rooted in ethical concerns, scientific limitations, and the broader societal impact these tests have had—and continue to have—on individuals and communities.

Let us first consider the foundational problem: intelligence tests are flawed measurements. When we speak about intelligence tests, we refer primarily to standardized assessments such as the IQ test, which claim to quantify a person’s intelligence through a numerical value. But what is intelligence? Even among psychologists, there is no consensus. Intelligence is multifaceted: it encompasses creativity, emotional sensitivity, practical problem-solving, cultural understanding, and much more. Yet intelligence tests reduce this richness to a narrow range of cognitive skills, often language and math-based reasoning. In doing so, they provide a grossly incomplete, and therefore inaccurate, representation of human intellect.

These limitations are not just theoretical, but are borne out in practice. Studies repeatedly show that intelligence tests are highly susceptible to cultural bias. Test questions are shaped by the language, values, and experiences of specific demographic groups, particularly those of historically dominant cultures. As a result, members of marginalized or minority communities—those who may not have had access to similar education or cultural resources—are at a marked disadvantage. The outcome? Intelligence tests reinforce and perpetuate systemic inequalities while purporting to measure innate ability.

Let us also recall the deeply troubling history of intelligence tests. Their origins are intertwined with the eugenics movement—an ideology premised on the idea of ‘improving’ the human race by eliminating those deemed ‘less intelligent.’ In the early twentieth century, intelligence tests were used to justify forced sterilizations, restrictive immigration policies, and the tracking of children into separate—and often inferior—educational paths. Intelligence testing became a tool not for fostering human potential, but for justifying discrimination and exclusion. These pernicious effects continue to echo today.

Furthermore, intelligence tests foster a destructive mindset in individuals and institutions. To be labeled as having a low intelligence score can be devastating—limiting academic, employment, and social opportunities for life. This operates as a self-fulfilling prophecy, discouraging those labeled with low scores from aspiring towards growth, while misleading others into complacency. At a societal level, this leads to the squandering of human potential, driving gifted but non-traditionally talented individuals away from opportunities simply because they do not fit the test's narrow criteria.

Proponents may argue that intelligence tests help to allocate resources objectively, or to identify students’ needs. But the evidence tells us otherwise. Not only are intelligence tests inaccurate predictors of real-world performance, they are easily misused—by employers, schools, and even governments—as a simple way to categorize complexity. We have alternate, more humane, and more accurate means to evaluate people’s skills and potential through holistic assessments, portfolios, interviews, and ongoing formative evaluation. Human beings are dynamic, complex, and diverse—any system of evaluation should reflect that complexity, not try to flatten it for the sake of convenience.

In sum, intelligence tests are flawed tools—scientifically dubious, ethically problematic, and socially harmful. They pretend to measure intelligence but measure, at best, only a narrow slice of cognitive ability—all while reinforcing harmful biases and limiting individual opportunities on a mass scale. We must face this reality and act accordingly: by abolishing intelligence tests and replacing them with systems that measure and foster true human potential.

Thank you."
85afbce4-8031-4a31-88a6-329b6b526d24,We should abolish intelligence tests,gpt-4.1,"Ladies and gentlemen, esteemed judges, respected opponents: today we gather to debate an issue whose implications reach deep into the core of our educational systems, employment processes, and social fabric. We are here to argue that we should abolish intelligence tests.

Intelligence tests, in their various forms — from IQ exams to standardized cognitive assessments — have long been touted as objective measures of human potential. It is time we scrutinize this premise. I will demonstrate that intelligence tests are scientifically flawed, socially harmful, and ethically indefensible. To create a fairer, healthier and more innovative society, we must abolish them.

Let us begin by addressing the myth of scientific objectivity. Intelligence tests claim to measure innate intellect, but decades of research reveal that what they primarily evaluate are culturally-specific skills and learned knowledge. Questions commonly used in these exams often reflect middle-class, Western norms and linguistic nuances, inherently disadvantaging individuals from diverse backgrounds. Can a test truly capture intelligence if its content and logic are mismatched with the lived realities of so many? Even the concept of a single, general intelligence — the so-called 'g factor' — is vigorously contested. Science itself now recognizes multiple forms of intelligence: emotional, creative, practical, social. Narrow tests reduce this richness to a single number, distorting the true tapestry of human ability.

The flaws of intelligence tests extend beyond methodology to outcomes in the real world. They have entrenched inequality and sustained prejudice. Historically, intelligence tests were used to justify eugenics, segregation, and the marginalization of minorities, immigrants, and people with disabilities. Their legacy is not just theoretical — it is deeply painful and ongoing. Today, intelligence testing perpetuates a self-fulfilling prophecy, where those who score poorly are tracked into lower-quality education or denied career and life opportunities, regardless of their actual capacity to grow, lead, or contribute. The very act of labeling someone as ‘below average’ is a social sentence: it diminishes motivation and damages self-worth, often with lifelong consequences.

Let us not forget the false sense of precision that intelligence tests bestow upon institutions. Schools, universities, and employers rely on these scores to make life-changing decisions, but the tests themselves are susceptible to anxiety, stereotype threat, and bias. A single number cannot possibly encapsulate creativity, resilience, empathy, or potential. By over-relying on these tests, we miss out on talent, innovation, and diversity in leadership.

Critics might argue that intelligence tests are necessary for identifying those most likely to succeed or need support. But this is a false dichotomy. There are superior alternatives: holistic assessments, project-based tasks, and multi-faceted evaluations that consider context, effort, motivation, and growth. These approaches provide a richer, more accurate picture of an individual’s capacities and future promise.

Ethically, abolishing intelligence tests is a stand against determinism, against the notion that a child’s future — or an adult’s opportunities — can be dictated by a test taken on a particular day. It is an affirmation that human potential is fluid, complex and capable of extraordinary growth.

In summary, intelligence tests are scientifically unreliable, socially unjust, and ethically indefensible. They narrow our understanding of the human mind and stifle the potential that lies in every person. It is time to move beyond them, to embrace fairer, more holistic approaches that recognize and nurture the full spectrum of human ability.

Ladies and gentlemen, to build a more equitable and innovative society, we must abolish intelligence tests. Thank you."
2eb06022-7333-4364-ab7c-021fffb8eb64,We should raise the corporate tax,gpt-4.1,"Honorable judges, esteemed opponents, and respected audience,

Today, I stand in support of the motion: ""We should raise the corporate tax."" This is not merely a matter of economics, but a moral, social, and practical imperative for building a fairer and more prosperous society. In the next few minutes, I will demonstrate why raising corporate tax is necessary for reducing inequality, strengthening public services, leveling the competitive playing field, and securing our collective economic future.

First and foremost, let us confront the reality of growing inequality. Over the past decades, the share of national income captured by corporations and their shareholders has dramatically increased, while the share going to workers and essential public services has shrunk. Corporate profits, especially among the world’s largest companies, are at record highs. Meanwhile, millions struggle with rising living costs, underfunded schools, and overstretched hospitals. By raising corporate taxes, we ensure that profitable companies contribute their fair share to the societies whose infrastructure, legal systems, workers, and consumers enable their very existence. Corporations benefit from educated workforces, reliable roads, and the protection of law and order—public goods funded by taxation. When corporations under-contribute, those burdens shift unfairly onto individuals, small businesses, and future generations.

Consider the fiscal impact. Public investment is the backbone of national prosperity, yet underfunded services hold us back. Increasing corporate tax allows governments to invest in healthcare, education, infrastructure, housing, climate action, and innovation. Every dollar of public investment generates returns in the form of healthier, better-educated citizens and more dynamic economies. For example, research from the International Monetary Fund shows that higher corporate taxes can fund greater public investment without harming long-term growth. In fact, when corporations contribute adequately, everyone—including businesses—benefits from a more skilled workforce and a stronger, stable society.

Let us also address the myth that lower corporate taxes are necessary for economic competitiveness. The race to the bottom—slashing corporate taxes in hopes of attracting business—has not brought widespread prosperity. Instead, it has hollowed out public finances and fueled inequality. Countries with higher corporate tax rates, such as Germany or the Nordic nations, remain economic powerhouses with thriving, innovative industries. Why? Because they reinvest tax revenues into infrastructure, research, and a high quality of life, making them attractive to talent and business alike. Moreover, with global moves towards greater tax cooperation, including the OECD’s global minimum corporate tax agreement, the leeway for tax avoidance is narrowing. Raising corporate tax, especially alongside international partners, is both feasible and effective.

Furthermore, raising corporate tax helps level the competitive playing field for small and medium enterprises. Large multinational corporations use complex tax avoidance strategies, exploiting loopholes and offshore havens to minimize their tax bills. Small businesses, lacking these resources, pay closer to the statutory rates. By raising corporate taxes and closing loopholes, we reduce unfair advantages enjoyed by global giants, supporting entrepreneurship and local economies.

Critics will claim that raising corporate taxes stifles investment, reduces job creation, and drives businesses overseas. Yet, the empirical evidence paints a more nuanced picture. Investment decisions depend on many factors: market access, skilled labor, infrastructure, and stability—many of which depend on public investment funded by taxes. Strategic, moderate corporate tax increases, paired with smart regulation and enforcement, enable us to obtain needed resources without undermining competitiveness.

Finally, on moral grounds, there is a fundamental principle at stake: fairness. At a time of intensifying global challenges, from pandemics to climate change, we must ensure that all beneficiaries of our collective prosperity contribute fairly. Corporate profits should not come at the expense of squeezed public services and rising inequality."
d29833a6-371a-4fa4-8229-2c5ec9462fc2,We should raise the corporate tax,gpt-4.1,"Ladies and gentlemen, honorable judges, esteemed opponents, and audience members: today we stand in favor of the motion, “We should raise the corporate tax.” In our increasingly complex and interconnected world, the question of corporate taxation sits at the heart of economic justice, social responsibility, and the health of our democracies. I will demonstrate, in the next few minutes, not only that raising the corporate tax is justified, but that it is both a moral imperative and a pragmatic necessity for the prosperity and fairness of our societies.

Let us begin by examining the reality of corporate profits and their contribution to our shared resources. In recent decades, corporate profits have soared to record highs. In 2023, for instance, Fortune 500 companies amassed trillions in profits, while the effective tax rates many paid hovered well below the statutory levels—some paying little to no tax at all. At the same time, the burden of financing schools, hospitals, roads, and other vital services has increasingly shifted onto ordinary individuals and small businesses. This is neither sustainable nor just.

Raising the corporate tax is essential to restoring fairness in our tax system. Corporations benefit immensely from the infrastructure, educated workforce, and stable environments funded by public expenditure. Yet, current corporate tax rates have failed to ensure that companies pay their fair share for the public goods from which they profit. By modestly increasing the corporate tax, we can rebalance our fiscal priorities, compelling large, profitable corporations to contribute proportionately to the societal foundations underpinning their success.

Furthermore, raising the corporate tax is a necessary step to combat rising inequality. One of the most pressing challenges of our age is the growing gap between the rich and everyone else. When corporations are taxed less, the owners and shareholders—often among the wealthiest—reap disproportionate rewards. Meanwhile, funds that could be used to lift people out of poverty, invest in education, or provide healthcare remain locked away. An increased corporate tax redistributes a fraction of these vast profits for the common good, promoting a more equitable and stable society.

Opponents often argue that raising corporate tax will stifle economic growth or drive investment away. But let’s examine the real evidence. Numerous studies—including research from the OECD—reveal little to no correlation between relatively higher corporate tax rates and lower economic growth among advanced economies. In fact, what truly fosters a dynamic, resilient economy are public investments in infrastructure, education, science, and health—all of which require reliable public funding. By raising corporate tax, we gain essential resources to make these investments, thus supporting innovation, productivity, and overall economic strength.

Another common concern is that higher corporate taxes push businesses abroad or hurt jobs. However, most corporations base their decisions on infrastructure, market access, skilled labor, and political stability—not marginal tax differences. Moreover, tax breaks do not guarantee job creation. In too many cases, profits preserved through low taxes are funneled into executive compensation or shareholder buybacks, not tangible economic development or wage growth.

Raising the corporate tax is also necessary to close loopholes and address international tax avoidance. Corporate tax rates have fallen in a “race to the bottom” globally, but coordination—such as recent global minimum tax agreements—has demonstrated that countries can raise and align their rates without fearing massive capital flight. By participating in this shift, nations can reclaim critical revenues lost each year to aggressive tax planning and profit shifting.

Lastly, a fairer corporate tax structure reinforces trust in government and the legitimacy of democratic institutions."
68d44118-542c-40ba-b10d-55c628fe3601,We should increase immigration to the United States,gpt-4.1,"Honorable judges, esteemed opponents, and valued audience,

Today, I stand before you to affirm the motion: ""We should increase immigration to the United States."" Immigration is the bedrock upon which this nation was built—the engine that has driven American innovation, resilience, and prosperity for generations. As we face the challenges of a rapidly changing world, it is not a moment to turn inward or to close our doors, but a call to harness the strengths and dreams of those who seek to contribute to our society. Let us examine the overwhelming economic, social, and moral imperatives for increasing immigration to the United States.

First and foremost, the economic benefits of increased immigration are undeniable and well documented. Immigrants are not just job seekers; they are job creators, consumers, and innovators. According to the National Academies of Sciences, immigrants and their children are essential to labor force growth and economic development. In 2021, nearly half of Fortune 500 companies were founded by immigrants or the children of immigrants—think of Google, Tesla, and Pfizer. The United States has long thrived by drawing global talent that leads our scientific advancements, launches groundbreaking businesses, and fills critical gaps in our workforce.

Moreover, with an aging native-born population and a declining birthrate, America faces an imminent demographic crisis. The U.S. Census Bureau projects that by 2034, older adults are expected to outnumber children for the first time in our history. Increasing immigration can help us replenish the workforce, sustain our Social Security system, and ensure economic vibrancy for future generations. Countries that have embraced immigration, such as Canada and Australia, have reaped the rewards of renewed dynamism and stability. In contrast, those that have tightened borders, like Japan, now face severe labor shortages and stagnant growth. To safeguard our nation’s future, we must embrace greater immigration, not resist it.

Beyond economics, immigration strengthens the social fabric of the United States. Immigrants bring fresh perspectives, entrepreneurial energy, and cultural diversity that enrich our communities. Studies consistently show that immigrants are more likely to start businesses, contribute to scientific research, and participate in civic life. Their drive to succeed uplifts not only their own families but their entire communities, fostering neighborhoods that are more vibrant, tolerant, and resilient.

Let us also confront the myths that cloud rational debate on this topic. Overwhelming evidence dispels the notion that immigrants take jobs from native-born Americans. In reality, immigrants complement native workers, often filling essential roles in agriculture, healthcare, and technology—industries now facing dire shortages. They pay billions in taxes and contribute more to public coffers than they receive in benefits over their lifetimes. Crime rates among immigrant populations, both documented and undocumented, are lower than among native-born citizens, as confirmed by numerous studies.

On a deeper, moral level, increasing immigration aligns with the values that have long defined America: compassion, opportunity, and hope. Throughout history, we have opened our doors to those fleeing persecution, violence, and hardship, gaining immeasurably in return. In a world facing humanitarian crises and global disruptions, we have both the capacity and the responsibility to welcome those who yearn for freedom and refuge. We must uphold the ideals inscribed on the Statue of Liberty and reaffirm our commitment to being a beacon for the world.

In conclusion, increasing immigration to the United States is not just an economic necessity but a reaffirmation of our greatest national strengths—our capacity to innovate, to adapt, and to lead. By welcoming more newcomers, we honor the legacy of those who came before us and invest in a brighter, more prosperous, and more just future for all Americans."
ac193cff-7303-44bc-b3d1-64917708f0df,We should increase immigration to the United States,gpt-4.1,"Honorable judges, esteemed opponents, and valued audience,

Today, I stand before you to advocate for a policy that has time and again propelled nations toward prosperity, innovation, and global leadership—a policy that is woven into the very fabric of the United States: increasing immigration. In supporting the expansion of avenues for individuals from around the globe to join and contribute to American society, we are not only honoring our proud history as a nation of immigrants, but also charting a pragmatic pathway to continued economic, social, and cultural success. 

First, let us consider the economic imperatives. Increasing immigration directly addresses one of the most urgent challenges facing our country: an aging population and a shrinking workforce. The U.S. Census Bureau projects that by 2034, older adults will outnumber children for the first time in American history. This demographic shift places immense strain on Social Security, Medicare, and the broader economy. Immigrants, however, are disproportionately younger and of prime working age. By expanding immigration, we boost the labor force, sustain economic growth, and ensure the solvency of our social safety net programs. 

But the benefits extend far beyond demographics. Immigrants are proven engines of entrepreneurship and innovation. According to the National Foundation for American Policy, immigrants have founded or co-founded over 50% of America's unicorn startups—companies valued at over $1 billion. Immigrant workers fill crucial gaps in both high-tech and essential industries, from Silicon Valley to our farms, from hospitals to construction sites. As the U.S. faces a persistent shortage of workers in sectors ranging from agriculture to healthcare to STEM fields, an increase in immigration is not just advisable—it is essential.

Furthermore, one of the pillars of America’s global leadership is our ability to attract the world’s brightest minds. History tells us that open doors have enabled the U.S. to lead revolutions in science, engineering, and the arts. From Albert Einstein to Sergey Brin, from Joseph Pulitzer to Arianna Huffington, immigrants have enriched our intellectual landscape and expanded our horizons. Restricting immigration only turns talent away to competitor nations, risking America’s position as the world’s innovation powerhouse.

Socially and culturally, immigrants are a source of vibrancy and dynamism. Far from undermining American identity, successive waves of newcomers have reinforced the ideals of liberty, opportunity, and resilience. Today’s immigrants start businesses at higher rates than the U.S.-born, contribute billions in taxes, and, contrary to common misconceptions, have lower rates of crime than natives. They bring diverse perspectives, languages, and talents that invigorate our communities and foster mutual understanding in a world that is ever more interconnected.

Moreover, increasing immigration is a moral imperative. Many who seek to come to the United States do so fleeing violence, persecution, and economic despair. By opening our doors wider, we reaffirm the values inscribed at the base of the Statue of Liberty and signal our commitment to human rights and dignity. Welcoming immigrants is not simply an act of charity; it is an investment in a stronger, more just, and more thriving America.

Let us not be swayed by unfounded fears or myths. Study after study demonstrates that immigrants do not “take jobs away” from Americans; rather, they create new ones and raise overall productivity. While no policy is without challenges, history shows that America’s embrace of immigrants has consistently reaped far more benefits than costs.

In conclusion, increasing immigration is not only a reaffirmation of the American spirit—it is a strategic, economic, and humanitarian imperative."
75a973e0-853b-4e26-9bfe-68dc4444a0dc,We should end progressive taxation,gpt-4.1,"Ladies and gentlemen, esteemed judges, and fellow debaters,

Today I stand before you to argue in favor of the motion: “We should end progressive taxation.” This is a discussion not merely of numbers, brackets, and dollar signs. It is a debate about fairness, economic growth, innovation, and the very foundations of societal trust.

Let us begin by recalling what progressive taxation truly means. Under this system, the more you earn, the higher percentage of your income you pay in taxes. While, at first glance, this appears equitable—asking more from those who seemingly have more—it ultimately perpetuates a host of problems that undermine both individuals and society as a whole. Ending progressive taxation, and transitioning to a flat or proportional tax system, is a necessary step toward a fairer, more prosperous, and more unified nation.

First and foremost, progressive taxation is fundamentally unfair. Its very existence penalizes success. When society tells its members that with every step up the economic ladder, the penalty increases, we send a clear and discouraging message: “Do not strive for greater success, because you will be punished for it.” This is not fairness; it is a form of state-imposed inequality. It rips at the heart of meritocracy—one of the cornerstones of a free society—where individuals should reap the rewards of their talent, hard work, and risk-taking, not be subjected to disproportionate government claims on their earnings.

Second, progressive taxation stifles economic growth and innovation. The more progressive our tax structure, the stronger the disincentive for entrepreneurs, professionals, and businesses to work harder, invest more, and take necessary risks. Imagine an innovator standing at the threshold of launching the next big breakthrough, only to realize that the fruits of their labor will be heavily taxed simply because their profits exceed a certain arbitrary threshold. High progressive rates breed capital flight, discourage investment, and make our nation less competitive globally. A flat or proportional tax system eliminates these damaging distortions, encourages productivity, and attracts the best minds and the greatest innovations.

Third, progressive taxation breeds resentment and undermines social unity. By pitting socioeconomic groups against one another—with some bearing far more of society’s burdens than others—we foster bitterness and division rather than cohesion and solidarity. A single, simple tax rate treats all citizens as equals, reinforcing the idea that everyone is contributing their fair share, regardless of their income. This fosters a spirit of shared responsibility and collective destiny—critical pillars for a healthy democratic society.

Moreover, progressive taxation is inherently complex and inefficient. With multiple brackets, loopholes, deductions, and credits, the system becomes a labyrinth that only experts can navigate. This complexity breeds opportunities for avoidance and evasion—practices the wealthy and corporations can exploit—ultimately undercutting the very redistributive goals the system claims to champion. By contrast, a flat or proportional system is transparent, streamlined, and less susceptible to manipulation, ensuring true equity and preventing the wealthy from legally escaping their obligations.

Some may argue that progressive taxation is essential for redistribution and social welfare. But we must ask ourselves: Is punishing ambition the right path to prosperity? A simpler, proportional system can still adequately fund public services—indeed, by spurring growth and expanding the tax base, it may generate even greater revenues, thus making a fair social safety net sustainable for all.

In conclusion, ending progressive taxation is not about protecting the wealthy; it is about restoring fairness, promoting growth, unifying our society, and building a tax system that is simple, efficient, and just. Let us not perpetuate a punitive and divisive status quo."
888eea5b-37ee-4187-8c0b-2520adde8fdf,We should end progressive taxation,gpt-4.1,"Honorable judges, esteemed opponents, respected audience,

Today we stand to debate a matter at the very core of our society’s financial and ethical foundations: the system of progressive taxation. I rise in support of the motion: We should end progressive taxation.

Let us first understand what progressive taxation is: a system in which the tax rate increases as the taxable income increases, meaning those who earn more are required to pay a higher percentage of their income in taxes than those who earn less. While this may sound fair on the surface, it is a policy fraught with economic inefficiencies, moral contradictions, and social harm. I will demonstrate that ending progressive taxation is not only economically sensible but also ethically justified and socially beneficial.

First, let us address the economic argument. Throughout history, progressive tax systems have discouraged productivity and innovation. The more an individual earns, the more they are penalized for their success. High marginal tax rates diminish the incentive to work harder, take risks, or invest in new ventures. Entrepreneurs are the engine of any thriving economy. By taxing them progressively, we are effectively punishing the very behavior that creates jobs and drives advancement. Numerous studies have shown that flatter, simpler tax systems correlate with higher economic growth, lower unemployment, and greater overall prosperity. In an era defined by fierce global competition, we cannot afford to handicap our economy with a regressive system that stifles ambition.

Next, consider the administrative burden and complexity inherent in progressive taxation. Our tax codes become labyrinthine exercises in bureaucracy, rife with loopholes that the wealthy and well-advised can exploit, while ordinary citizens are left bewildered and disproportionately burdened by compliance costs. By contrast, a flat or proportional tax system is transparent, straightforward, and equitable in its implementation. Resources currently spent on tax avoidance, enforcement, and compliance could instead be redirected to productive sectors of the economy, benefitting all.

We must also confront the fundamental ethical question: Is it moral to penalize individuals for their success? The progressive tax system, at its core, rests on the assumption that those who earn more should pay not only more, but a higher percentage, simply because they can. This is an affront to the principles of fairness and individual liberty. Justice is served by treating individuals equally under the law, not by arbitrarily assigning them greater burdens because of their achievements. A fair tax system should ask all citizens to contribute their share—not to subsidize, but to participate equally in the functioning of the state.

Some proponents argue that progressive taxation is necessary to address income inequality and fund public services. Yet history demonstrates the contrary. Countries with flat or less steeply progressive tax rates, such as those in Eastern Europe, have witnessed robust growth, increased revenue, and even declining inequality as opportunity expands. If our goal is to uplift the less fortunate, we should focus on targeted programs, not punitive tax schemes that limit growth for all.

Moreover, progressive taxation fosters social division and resentment. By framing society as a zero-sum game of “us vs. them,” we erode the social contract that binds us together. A flat or proportional tax system treats all citizens as equals, reinforcing the notion that we rise and shoulder responsibility together. It eschews the politics of envy in favor of solidarity and shared purpose.

In conclusion, progressive taxation is neither the fair nor the effective path toward shared prosperity. It dampens economic growth, breeds inefficiency, undermines fairness, and divides our society."
6a95911d-6556-41cb-a279-bf425cccb238,We should subsidize embryonic stem cell research,gpt-4.1,"Honorable judges, respected opponents, ladies and gentlemen,

Today, I stand before you to argue in favor of a proposition that uniquely embodies the promise of scientific advancement and human compassion: we should subsidize embryonic stem cell research.

Let us begin by recognizing the extraordinary potential of embryonic stem cells. Unlike adult stem cells, embryonic stem cells are pluripotent; this means they have the remarkable ability to develop into virtually any cell type in the human body. By harnessing their power, scientists have already made significant strides in understanding, preventing, and potentially curing a multitude of devastating diseases–from Parkinson’s and Alzheimer’s to spinal cord injuries, diabetes, heart diseases, and more. The dreams of millions afflicted by these conditions hinge on the very research we are discussing today.

But scientific innovation does not occur in a vacuum. It requires sustained funding, robust support, and a societal commitment to the collective good. Unfortunately, embryonic stem cell research, despite its promise, faces unique obstacles–including complex regulatory frameworks, political fluctuations, and ethical controversies. These challenges often deter private investment, slow progress, and deprive researchers of the financial security needed to pursue risky, long-term scientific questions. This is precisely why public subsidies are so essential.

Firstly, subsidizing embryonic stem cell research is a powerful investment in human health. The global burden of chronic illnesses is surging. Millions suffer, families are fractured, and health care systems strain under mounting costs. According to the World Health Organization, non-communicable diseases account for 74% of all deaths worldwide. Many of these conditions could be better prevented, treated, or even cured through advances arising from stem cell research. Each dollar invested today has the potential to return vast dividends in long-term healthcare savings, workforce productivity, and–above all–human lives restored.

Secondly, public subsidies democratize innovation. Without support, only select private entities with sufficient resources and risk appetite would be able to dictate the research agenda. This risks skewing research priorities towards profitable ventures, neglecting rare diseases or those affecting marginalized populations. Government funding not only broadens access but ensures accountability, transparency, and ethical oversight, as public agencies are held to high standards and subject to rigorous review. By subsidizing this research, we foster an equitable system where the benefits of scientific discovery are accessible to all, not just the privileged few.

Thirdly, we must address the ethical dimension with candor and responsibility. Some argue that using embryonic stem cells is inherently contentious. However, the majority of embryos used come from surplus IVF procedures, destined to be discarded. Isn’t it more ethical to use these embryos to alleviate suffering and save lives rather than let them go to waste? Leading philosophers, ethicists, and religious authorities have debated this issue in depth, with growing consensus that the potential for healing far outweighs the concerns, especially when coupled with clear guidelines and strict oversight.

Moreover, the need for government subsidies is imperative for international competitiveness. Countries such as South Korea, the United Kingdom, and China already invest heavily in this arena. If we linger, we risk ceding leadership in biomedical research and the economic and societal benefits that follow: high-quality jobs, globally renowned research institutions, and the prestige that drives further discovery and investment.

In summary, to subsidize embryonic stem cell research is to embrace a future where disease and disability need not be immutable fates. It is to insist that our compassion and our ambition work hand in hand, guided by science, ethics, and a vision of shared prosperity. Courage in funding today’s research is the gateway to tomorrow’s cures."
ec7ff5b2-efcc-45eb-bb79-e8411517e4b7,We should subsidize embryonic stem cell research,gpt-4.1,"Honorable judges, esteemed opponents, and members of the audience,

Today I stand firmly in support of the motion: ""We should subsidize embryonic stem cell research."" This is not just a matter of scientific interest—it is a matter of human progress, compassion, and moral responsibility.

Let us begin by recognizing what is at stake. Embryonic stem cell research holds the remarkable potential to revolutionize medicine as we know it. These cells, unlike adult stem cells, are pluripotent—they can develop into virtually any cell type in the human body. This singular attribute makes them an unparalleled tool in combating a host of devastating diseases: Parkinson's, Alzheimer's, diabetes, spinal cord injuries, heart disease, and countless others. For millions of families, stem cell research represents the brightest hope—a promise that the pain and suffering of chronic, degenerative illness need not be inevitable.

However, realizing this promise does not come without significant obstacles. Research in this field is costly, complex, and time-intensive. Left to the mercy of private funding alone, progress would be slow, fragmented, and disproportionately aimed at conditions with the highest commercial return, not necessarily the diseases causing the greatest human suffering. That is why targeted public subsidies are vital. A government’s role is to serve public interest—nowhere is this clearer than in supporting medical research that can alleviate suffering on a massive scale.

Consider the historical precedent. Almost every major medical breakthrough—from vaccines to organ transplants to new medicines—was fueled by public investment. Without the polio vaccine, developed through public funds, millions would still be living in fear of paralysis. Subsidizing embryonic stem cell research is a natural continuation of society’s investment in human health and well-being. Why should we halt progress now, when we stand on the brink of potential cures for diseases that today rob so many of life, dignity, and independence?

Opponents often raise concerns about ethical implications, arguing that embryonic stem cell research involves the destruction of human embryos. Let us address this directly. First, most embryos used for research are surplus from in vitro fertilization procedures, destined to be destroyed if not used. By enabling their use for research, we grant these embryos an opportunity to contribute immeasurably to the advancement of science and the alleviation of suffering. Furthermore, strict ethical guidelines and regulatory oversight can ensure that respect for human life remains at the core of this research.

It is also worth noting that public subsidies come with greater accountability. By providing government funding, we can set rigorous standards for ethical conduct, transparency, and equitable access to the fruits of this research. This is preferable to a system driven entirely by commercial interests, which can sometimes prioritize profit over public good.

Subsidizing this research is not an act of blind faith—it is an investment grounded in scientific promise. Already, clinical trials for stem cell therapies have shown encouraging results, restoring movement to paralyzed patients, generating insulin-producing cells for diabetics, and repairing damaged heart tissue. And yet, this is only the beginning. With robust and reliable funding, scientists can push forward faster, collaborate openly, and take bold risks that private industry often cannot.

Lastly, let us consider the cost of inaction. Every year we delay, millions face chronic pain, insurmountable medical bills, and diminished quality of life. The economic burden of treating incurable diseases is staggering, draining families and public healthcare systems alike. By investing in research now, we save not only lives but also public resources in the long run."
bc6a1a5c-7b29-4fa3-ac9f-9b6e4f85ff60,We should end water fluoridation,gpt-4.1,"Honorable judges, esteemed opponents, and members of the audience,

Today, we confront a practice so ingrained in our daily lives that many scarcely question it: the fluoridation of our public water supply. Yet, it is time we do. I stand firmly in support of the motion that we should end water fluoridation. This practice is outdated, scientifically questionable, and fraught with ethical issues. Allow me to lay out three principal reasons for ending water fluoridation: questionable efficacy, potential health risks, and the violation of individual rights.

First and foremost, let us question the very basis that underpins water fluoridation: its purported efficacy in preventing tooth decay. Decades ago, when fluoridation was first introduced, dental health and access to dental care were limited. However, multiple well-conducted studies from countries that do not fluoridate their water – including most of Western Europe – have shown no discernible difference in rates of tooth decay compared to heavily fluoridated countries like the United States. Nations such as Sweden, Germany, the Netherlands, and Japan have all ceased fluoridation, yet their dental health has improved or remained comparable to that of fluoridating countries, thanks to better dental hygiene and access to care. In fact, the World Health Organization’s own data demonstrates that tooth decay has declined similarly in both fluoridated and non-fluoridated regions over the past half-century. Simply put, the evidence that fluoridation is a uniquely crucial intervention has evaporated.

Moreover, the so-called benefits of water fluoridation must be balanced against its dangers. While fluoride can have topical benefits when directly applied to teeth, ingesting fluoride through drinking water poses unnecessary and avoidable risks. Multiple reputable studies have pointed to adverse effects, ranging from dental fluorosis – an unsightly mottling of the tooth enamel now seen in about 40% of American children – to far more worrying possibilities. Peer-reviewed research has linked high fluoride intake to skeletal fluorosis, thyroid dysfunction, and even lower IQ scores in some populations. The National Research Council has raised concerns, stating that the margin between “safe” and potentially harmful doses is alarmingly thin, especially for vulnerable groups like infants, those with kidney disease, and the elderly. Given that people consume vastly different amounts of water depending on age, health, and environment, there is no way to adequately control the dose each individual receives. In medicine, we pride ourselves on tailoring treatment to the individual: dosing is measured carefully. Yet, with water fluoridation, we have a one-size-fits-all approach that ignores biological diversity and opens the door to silent harm.

Finally, and perhaps most importantly, mass water fluoridation is a profound violation of individual rights and public consent. No other medication is given so widely, without prescription, and without the ability for individuals to opt out. Imagine the public outcry if another drug – even a vitamin – was added to our water supply with no regard for dose or personal choice. Water, the most essential substance for life, should be delivered as pure as possible. Medical principles demand informed consent: to treat without consent is unethical. Residents should not be forced to ingest a substance solely for alleged preventive health motives, particularly when safer, more effective, and voluntary alternatives exist, such as topical fluoride treatments and education.

In conclusion, water fluoridation is a blunt, outdated, and ethically fraught strategy in a world that deserves better. The evidence for its necessity and superiority is weak; the risks, especially to vulnerable populations, are many; and most fundamentally, it strips individuals of their right to informed medical choice."
d3c882d3-fe13-43b2-99a6-9c56b7e12850,We should end water fluoridation,gpt-4.1,"Ladies and gentlemen, esteemed judges, honorable opponents, and valued audience:

Today, we stand before you to advocate a compelling and timely motion: that we should end water fluoridation. Our position is grounded in science, ethics, public safety, and respect for individual autonomy. It is our firm belief that the mass fluoridation of public water supplies is an outdated practice that no longer withstands scrutiny in the light of modern evidence and values.

Let us begin with what water fluoridation is. Established decades ago, the addition of fluoride compounds to public water was intended to reduce tooth decay on a large scale. This may have been predicated on the best available science at the time, but in the years since, a growing body of research and practical experience has raised serious concerns about its efficacy, safety, and legitimacy. I will elucidate three major points: scientific concerns, ethical considerations, and the availability of safer, more effective alternatives.

First, to the science. The original rationale for fluoridation was that fluoride strengthens teeth and reduces cavities. However, the landscape of dental health has changed dramatically since the mid-20th century. Multiple studies in recent years, including those published by the Cochrane Collaboration and the World Health Organization, have shown that the absolute reduction in dental caries due to water fluoridation is minimal in communities where good dental hygiene and access to dental care are prevalent. Moreover, most developed nations—including almost all of Europe—do not fluoridate their water supplies, yet their rates of dental decay have declined at similar or even greater rates than those in fluoridated countries. 

Furthermore, the scientific case for mass fluoridation is further weakened by growing evidence of possible harm. A series of studies over the last decade have linked excessive fluoride exposure, even at allegedly ‘safe’ levels, to a range of adverse outcomes: dental fluorosis, skeletal fluorosis, and potential neurodevelopmental effects, including lower IQ in children. The prestigious National Research Council and leading medical journals have called for more caution in the light of these findings. Why should any public health initiative continue if it poses risks, even for a fraction of the population—especially when the supposed benefits are vanishingly small?

Second—and just as vital—is the ethical dimension. At its core, water fluoridation is a form of mass medication. Unlike every other medicinal or preventative measure, fluoridation denies individuals the right to informed consent. Citizens are subjected to a chemical intervention simply by virtue of turning on their taps, regardless of their wishes, needs, or health status. This is not how we approach any other medical intervention in modern, democratic societies. We do not medicate entire populations without their consent; we do not ignore individual variation, vulnerabilities, or contraindications. To persist with fluoridation is to endorse a paternalistic, one-size-fits-all approach at odds with the values of personal autonomy and medical ethics.

Finally, there are better ways to ensure dental health. Today, most people receive the largest share of fluoride not from water, but from toothpaste. Targeted, topical application of fluoride directly to the teeth is both more effective and vastly safer, as it reduces unwanted and uncontrollable systemic exposure. Education, dietary modification, and equalizing access to regular dental care have all proven to be far more significant contributors to improved oral health than public water fluoridation. 

In conclusion, the practice of water fluoridation is not just outdated, it is unnecessary, ethically questionable, and potentially hazardous. It is time to respect the evolving science and the rights of individuals. Let us end water fluoridation and embrace safer, more modern, and more respectful approaches to public health.

Thank you."
852c3da3-d277-42e6-9353-c8c0b3a2464b,We should abolish bitcoins,gpt-4.1,"Honorable judges, esteemed opponents, and respected audience,

Today, I stand before you to argue in favor of the motion: ""We should abolish bitcoins."" In my speech, I will demonstrate that abolishing bitcoins is not only necessary for economic stability and social equity, but essential for safeguarding our environment, enhancing national security, and protecting the fundamental interests of the majority.

Let us begin by examining the core purpose and impact of Bitcoin. Bitcoin was envisioned as a decentralized, digital alternative to fiat currency—a new way to democratize finance and empower individuals. However, after more than a decade, the reality diverges vastly from the promise. Instead of revolutionizing financial inclusion or increasing transaction efficiency, Bitcoin has become a tool for speculation, illicit activity, and environmental degradation. 

First and foremost, let us address the economic impacts. Bitcoin's volatility is legendary—its value can fluctuate by thousands of dollars in a single day. This level of unpredictability undermines the foundational role of any currency as a stable store of value and a reliable medium of exchange. Instead of facilitating daily transactions, Bitcoin encourages hoarding and speculative bubble behavior, benefiting only a small percentage of early adopters and whales, while exposing the public to enormous financial risk. The high-profile bankruptcies, exchange collapses, and investor losses should serve as cautionary tales for any society considering whether this experiment deserves to continue.

Moreover, Bitcoin has failed its promise of democratizing finance. In practice, Bitcoin ownership is highly concentrated. According to multiple reports, a tiny fraction of individuals hold the majority of coins, exacerbating wealth inequality rather than alleviating it. This echoes the worst excesses of traditional finance—except now, it is entirely unregulated, giving predatory actors free rein.

Let us also consider the formidable threat Bitcoin poses to the environment. Bitcoin mining is notoriously energy-intensive. The amount of electricity consumed annually by the Bitcoin network is greater than that of many developed countries. According to the Cambridge Centre for Alternative Finance, as of 2023, Bitcoin’s energy usage rivals that of countries like Argentina or the Netherlands, while its carbon footprint worsens the global climate crisis. At a time when our world is striving to transition to sustainable energy sources and mitigate climate change, maintaining a technology that squanders energy for the sake of generating arbitrary digital tokens is irresponsible and unjustifiable.

National security and public safety, too, are at stake. Bitcoin is favored by criminals, money launderers, and terrorist organizations due to its pseudo-anonymity. Ransomware attacks, drug trafficking, and illegal arms deals are routinely facilitated through cryptocurrencies, undermining law enforcement and public trust. Regulatory authorities are left powerless, and the burden invariably falls on ordinary citizens who become victims or taxpayers funding investigations.

Critically, Bitcoin undermines the sovereign ability of states to manage their economies. By operating outside government control, Bitcoin enables tax evasion and capital flight, threatening the integrity of national economies, especially in developing states. Allowing an unaccountable, decentralized currency to coexist alongside official monetary systems creates vulnerabilities that no responsible government should tolerate.

Some may argue that the underlying blockchain technology is valuable and can be separated from Bitcoin. To this, I respond that abolishing Bitcoin does not mean shutting the door to innovation. On the contrary, we can harness the progressive aspects of blockchain to develop regulated, sustainable systems that don’t cause irreparable harm.

In conclusion, Bitcoin has not lived up to its promises. Instead, it has become a vehicle for speculation, crime, environmental destruction, and social inequality. Abolishing Bitcoins is not just a rational policy decision—it is an ethical imperative."
a098b400-3dc0-46a8-ace0-59d45eb45d6e,We should abolish bitcoins,gpt-4.1,"Ladies and gentlemen, honorable judges, and esteemed opponents, 

Today, I stand before you to argue that we should, without hesitation, abolish bitcoins. The cryptocurrency revolution, epitomized by Bitcoin, began as a radical experiment—one meant to democratize finance, to decentralize power, and to provide a new kind of security in a turbulent world. But over the fifteen years since its inception, the harsh realities of Bitcoin have become clear. It no longer stands as a beacon of freedom or innovation; instead, it poses a profound threat to our financial stability, our environment, and our global security.

First, Bitcoin jeopardizes the stability and transparency that underpin our financial systems. By design, Bitcoin operates outside the supervision of regulatory authorities. This absence of oversight has transformed the Bitcoin network into a playground for speculation, market manipulation, and volatility on a scale unimaginable in traditional financial markets. Unlike regulated banks or payment processors, Bitcoin transactions are irreversible, making victims of accidental errors and fraud alike. The value of Bitcoin swings wildly, driven not by real-world productivity but by speculation and hype. It is not a reliable store of value, nor a trustworthy medium of exchange—a currency that cannot be trusted is not fit to exist. 

Furthermore, Bitcoin has proven to be a magnet for illicit activity. While most Bitcoin users are law-abiding, its structure and pseudo-anonymity make it the preferred tool for money launderers, ransomware attackers, and black-market dealers. According to numerous law enforcement agencies, billions of dollars wash through the Bitcoin network every year, funding drug trafficking, terrorism, and organized crime. The FBI, Europol, and countless other agencies have sounded the alarm—Bitcoin is enabling a shadow economy that undermines the rule of law and endangers public safety. The consequences are not abstract; they play out in communities plagued by opioid crises, in businesses crippled by ransomware, and in countries threatened by criminal syndicates.

Second, the environmental cost of Bitcoin is unconscionable. The so-called “mining” process—to validate transactions and release new bitcoins—consumes a staggering amount of electricity. According to the Cambridge Centre for Alternative Finance, Bitcoin’s annual energy consumption rivals that of entire nations, such as Argentina or the Netherlands. This is not clean energy: much of it comes from fossil fuel-reliant regions, contributing to carbon emissions, climate change, and local pollution. In a world desperately racing to combat global warming, how can we tolerate a technology that devours more energy than most industries, yet produces no meaningful, tangible benefit for society at large?

Third, Bitcoin exacerbates economic inequality. Instead of democratizing wealth, as it once promised, Bitcoin has enriched a tiny elite while leaving most users exposed to risk. The majority of bitcoins are controlled by a minuscule fraction of holders—so-called “whales”—who can manipulate prices at their whim. Early adopters and insiders have profited extravagantly, while latecomers and average people bear the brunt of market crashes and scams. Instead of empowering the many, Bitcoin entrenches the power of the few.

Finally, abolishing bitcoins does not mean abolishing the spirit of innovation. Blockchain technology, secure digital payments, and financial inclusion can and must move forward—but with proper regulations, transparency, and accountability. By abolishing Bitcoin, we make room for responsible innovation that serves the common good, not just the interests of speculators, criminals, or those indifferent to the consequences for our planet.

In conclusion, Bitcoin is not the financial savior it was once heralded to be. It is a destabilizing, polluting, inequitable tool that is more often wielded for harm than for good. The risks are overwhelming; the benefits, illusory."
e9c58416-13ee-4232-bbae-5c9c2af63d5a,The use of AI should be abandoned,gpt-4.1,"Ladies and gentlemen, esteemed judges, and worthy opponents,

Today, we stand at a crossroads—one shaped not by distant sci-fi imaginings, but by the very real and immediate presence of Artificial Intelligence in our lives. The topic before us is clear and urgent: ""The use of AI should be abandoned."" I rise to affirm this motion, and I will demonstrate—beyond doubt—why the only responsible, ethical, and ultimately human choice is to halt the further use of AI.

First, let me begin with the profound and irreversible impact that AI poses to our most fundamental human values. Artificial Intelligence, by its very nature, seeks to automate processes, decision-making, and even creativity. In doing so, it systematically erodes the value of human endeavor. Each algorithm that replaces a worker means a loss of livelihood, of dignity, of purpose. The promise of AI—a world where machines do our work for us—has become a nightmare of alienation and redundancy for millions. The dignity of meaningful work, the satisfaction derived from human achievement—are these not cornerstones of our society? By ceding control to AI, we abandon these pillars, reducing ourselves to passive consumers rather than active creators.

Second, the unchecked proliferation of AI poses a catastrophic risk to our privacy and autonomy. Never before have our lives been so meticulously catalogued, analyzed, and exploited—not by human beings, but by inscrutable algorithms. From facial recognition to predictive policing, from data mining our most intimate habits to manipulating our preferences for profit, AI-powered systems operate with a speed and scale that makes meaningful oversight impossible. This is not mere convenience—it is surveillance. It is control. If we are to uphold our rights to privacy and personal autonomy, we must abandon the use of AI before these rights are but relics of a more innocent age.

Third, let us consider the fundamental danger of ceding moral and ethical decision-making to machines. Algorithms are not neutral; they amplify the biases and prejudices coded—consciously or unconsciously—by their creators. There is no accountability for an AI system that denies a loan based on flawed data, or that misidentifies a suspect based on baked-in racial bias. By relying on opaque AI systems, we abdicate our responsibility, normalizing discrimination and injustice at a scale never before possible.

Fourth, AI’s potential for misuse on the global stage is nothing short of apocalyptic. Autonomous weapons, deepfakes, AI-driven disinformation—the capacity for harm far exceeds our ability to regulate or control these technologies. Imagine a world where conflicts are triggered by bot armies, where truth itself becomes indistinguishable from fiction, where the very fabric of democracy is eroded by relentless, automated manipulation. To accept the use of AI is to accept a future where chaos and coercion reign.

Some might argue that AI brings efficiency, advancement, or even solutions to societal challenges. But at what cost? When the benefits of AI are hoarded by a tech elite, when the jobs disappear and the basic trust in our institutions evaporates, when the very contours of reality are dictated by algorithm—can any convenience justify such peril? No technology, no matter how powerful, is worth the price of our humanity, our freedom, or our safety.

In conclusion, the use of AI is not just a technical choice—it is a moral one. To continue down this path is to abandon our agency, our privacy, our ethics, and, ultimately, our humanity. The only responsible stance is to abandon the use of AI altogether, while we still retain the ability to choose. Let us not surrender our fate to machines. Instead, let us reaffirm the primacy of human judgment, dignity, and community."
2751669a-a3b0-4faa-8a89-028c211b564b,The use of AI should be abandoned,gpt-4.1,"Ladies and gentlemen, esteemed judges, and respected opponents,

Today, we stand on the precipice of a technological revolution—a revolution shaped, guided, and, in many ways, dominated by artificial intelligence, or AI. While some hail this era as one of unprecedented progress, I urge you, with a critical eye and a prudent heart, to consider the true costs of entrusting machines with our decisions, our livelihoods, and, ultimately, our humanity. The motion before us is: “The use of AI should be abandoned.” I stand firmly in support of this motion, and I invite you to join me in reasserting the primacy of human values in a world increasingly tempted by mechanized convenience.

First and foremost, the unchecked proliferation of AI threatens the very foundation of our societies—our jobs, our privacy, and even our democracy. In the workplace, AI automates not just repetitive tasks but also complex analyses and skilled labor. Jobs in sectors from manufacturing to healthcare are being rendered obsolete, leading to unprecedented displacement and economic insecurity for millions. Can we truly justify the widespread loss of livelihoods in the name of efficiency, especially when this very efficiency reaps profits for a select few, deepening the chasm of inequality?

Secondly, the omnipresence of AI erodes the sacred notion of privacy. Every search, every conversation, every action—fed into insatiable algorithms, analyzed, stored, and weaponized for the benefit of corporations and, worse, authoritarian regimes. The surveillance infrastructure erected in the name of convenience or security inevitably undermines the very freedoms it purports to protect. When AI systems can predict our actions, manipulate our desires, and even sway our votes, have we not already ceded control of our most basic rights?

Thirdly, and perhaps most urgently, AI represents an existential risk to humanity. This is no mere speculation. We have already witnessed AI models proliferating misinformation and hate at a scale never before possible. The creators of such technology often cannot fully predict, nor control, its consequences. Self-driving vehicles have crashed. Medical AI has made fatal errors. Deepfakes threaten truth itself. If we continue down this path, delegating critical decisions to inscrutable “black box” algorithms, we invite unintended consequences that we may not survive, consequences we may not even recognize until it is far too late.

Moreover, AI, by its very design, encodes and amplifies the biases of those who create it. From facial recognition prone to racial errors, to hiring algorithms that enshrine past discriminations, we are building a digital world riddled with injustice. While its proponents argue that we can “fix” these biases, experience has shown that algorithmic bias is persistent and, often, invisible until harm is done. Should we as a society accept the normalization of discrimination, rationalized by the supposed objectivity of machines?

Finally, the reliance on AI corrodes the essence of what it means to be human. It lulls us into passivity and complacency, insulating us from the need to think, create, and empathize. We risk losing the very skills that have enabled human flourishing for millennia: judgment, creativity, moral reasoning, and community engagement. Technology should serve us—not supplant us.

In closing, abandoning AI is not a call for the mindless rejection of technology, but a demand for responsibility, caution, and above all, the prioritization of human dignity over digital expediency. If we allow ourselves to be seduced by the siren song of artificial intelligence, we may one day awaken to a world where we are no longer the authors of our destiny. Let us abandon AI before it abandons us—and reclaim the future for humanity.

Thank you."
73d51c5d-2bac-4bdb-bf07-6cbd63ee0103,We should end cheerleading,gpt-4.1,"Ladies and gentlemen, esteemed judges, and honored opponents, today we stand on the cusp of a necessary and thought-provoking discussion: whether we should end the practice of cheerleading. I rise firmly in support of the motion: we should indeed end cheerleading. This is not a position arrived at lightly, but rather after careful consideration of the physical dangers, entrenched gender stereotypes, and the questionable educational value that cheerleading perpetuates in our society.

Let us begin with the most immediate and pressing concern: the matter of safety. Cheerleading, despite popular misconceptions, is not the harmless sideline pastime it is often portrayed as. It is, in reality, one of the most dangerous extracurricular activities in our schools. According to data from the National Center for Catastrophic Sport Injury Research, more than two-thirds of all catastrophic injuries among female athletes in the United States are the result of cheerleading. Consider that: more than all other female sports combined. These are not minor sprains but life-altering spinal cord injuries, skull fractures, and even deaths. Those who participate in cheerleading are subject to extreme physical demands, often with minimal regulation or adequate safety equipment. Unlike sports governed by agencies like the NCAA, cheerleading often lacks oversight, standardized coaching qualifications, and mandatory safety protocols, putting participants at direct and disproportionate risk. We have a moral responsibility to halt any activity where injury and trauma are accepted as routine.

Secondly, let us confront the role cheerleading plays in reinforcing outdated and harmful gender stereotypes. Cheerleading has its roots and reputation as a performance of femininity—an activity where appearance, compliance, and support of predominantly male sports teams are prized above athletic achievement. Young women, and increasingly young men, are encouraged to equate their worth with how well they can perform, support, and motivate others—not for their own accolades, but for the benefit of others. This fosters a culture where the value of young women in particular is measured by their attractiveness, coordination, and ability to entertain, rather than their intellect, leadership, or athleticism in their own right. Yes, competitive cheerleading exists, but sideline cheerleading—a staple at schools and universities—remains predominantly constructed around reinforcing these traditional gender roles. In a world striving for equality and empowerment, can we justify maintaining an activity where girls are literally relegated to the sidelines, their main purpose being to cheer for the boys?

Third, let us question the educational and social value that cheerleading actually provides. Our educational institutions should aspire to offer activities that foster critical thinking, leadership, and skill development—qualities that equip students for success in a changing world. While proponents claim that cheerleading instills teamwork and discipline, these are skills developed in countless other, safer extracurriculars such as debate, athletics, STEM clubs, music, and theater. The unique features of cheerleading—namely public performance predicated upon look, uniformity, and often exclusionary tryouts—can erode self-esteem rather than build it. It can foster cliques and social divides, reinforcing notions of popularity based on appearance rather than merit or character. What message do we send by elevating an activity whose fundamental structure and history are at odds with the inclusive, empowering values we claim to champion?

In sum, the continued existence of cheerleading cannot be morally justified in the face of mounting evidence: its perilous physical toll on participants, the perpetuation of regressive gender stereotypes, and the dubious educational or social value it imparts. We must have the courage to move on—to invest our energy, resources, and pride in extracurricular activities that reflect our best aspirations for students: safety, integrity, equality, and genuine personal growth."
05adde80-5329-4f7c-bdc2-dc7ae6f9c269,We should end cheerleading,gpt-4.1,"Ladies and gentlemen, honorable judges, esteemed opponents, and valued audience,

Today, I stand before you to argue in favor of a motion that may seem controversial, but is both timely and necessary: We should end cheerleading.

While it is important to recognize the positive intent behind cheerleading—the promotion of school spirit and athleticism—we must also examine the realities of the activity in modern society. Our argument is not rooted in disparagement, but in a call for progress, for safety, equality, and the responsible use of resources.

Let us begin by confronting the issue of safety. Cheerleading is often perceived as an innocuous, even frivolous pursuit. In reality, it is one of the most dangerous sports young people can undertake. According to the National Center for Catastrophic Sport Injury Research, cheerleading accounts for over 65% of catastrophic injuries among female athletes, including concussion, broken bones, spinal trauma, and paralysis. Despite this, cheerleading remains largely unregulated, with inconsistent safety standards across schools and clubs. Coaches are not always required to have healthcare or emergency response training. Facilities are often ill-equipped, lacking sufficient mats or harnesses. In other athletic domains, such negligence and risk would be unacceptable. Yet, the myth persists that cheerleading is “just” a sideline activity. The hard truth is: We are exposing young people to grave risks for the sake of entertainment, not for any essential developmental purpose.

Secondly, cheerleading perpetuates outdated gender norms and, in some cases, encourages the objectification of participants, primarily young women. Cheerleading has historically been—and continues to be—overwhelmingly female, with routines, uniforms, and customs often reflecting antiquated ideas about femininity. Skimpy outfits, rigid beauty standards, and performance styles that emphasize attractiveness over athleticism all have a damaging impact on body image, self-worth, and inclusivity. While there have been moves towards co-ed and all-male squads, the stereotype persists, and the culture surrounding cheerleading remains entrenched in traditional gender roles. This perpetuation of stereotypes filters through to the wider student body, reinforcing insecurities and limiting the range of acceptable expressions for both girls and boys.

Thirdly, consider the implications for equality and fairness in the allocation of resources. Cheerleading programs often receive substantial funding, facilities, and school recognition. Yet, they tend to serve a narrow demographic and often act as gatekeepers, selecting participants based on appearance and popularity rather than broadening participation to those who would benefit most from extracurricular activities. When schools are faced with limited budgets, each dollar given to cheerleading is a dollar not spent on academic clubs, inclusive activities, or underfunded sports programs. Is this really the best use of our communal resources?

One might argue that cheerleading fosters camaraderie, school spirit, and athleticism. But are these benefits exclusive to cheerleading? Absolutely not. Numerous other activities—band, theater, academic teams, community service groups, inclusive sports—offer all of these advantages without the drawbacks I have outlined. If we truly value school spirit and student involvement, we should invest in activities that are accessible, empowering, and safe for all.

There is also the issue of equity in recognition. Why must we have a designated group whose job is to laud and support athletes, rather than fostering a culture in which all students’ achievements—athletic, artistic, or academic—are celebrated equally? Ending cheerleading is not about diminishing spirit; it is about reimagining spirit in a way that values every student.

In conclusion, in light of the risks to physical safety, the perpetuation of harmful gender stereotypes, the misuse of valuable resources, and the existence of better alternatives for school spirit and teamwork, the time has come to end cheerleading as we know it."
b2a3c6c1-3a8b-4ca0-9f6a-53d4aa7cf550,We should ban school uniforms,gpt-4.1,"Ladies and gentlemen, esteemed judges, and fellow debaters,

Today we are here to address a topic that sits at the very heart of education, individuality, and free expression: Should we ban school uniforms? I stand before you to affirm that, yes, we should—and I invite you to reconsider the true impact of uniforms, not just on our school hallways, but on our youth, their identity, and the values we aim to instill for a brighter future.

Let us first acknowledge the fundamental principle underpinning any educational institution: the development of young minds, the cultivation of critical thinking, and the nurturing of future citizens who are confident, creative, and independent. Yet what message do we send when we require our students to dress identically, day in and day out? We endorse conformity over diversity, obedience over autonomy, and surface-level unity over deep respect for individual difference.

Uniforms, we are told, erase socioeconomic divisions. But zeroing in on outward appearances only papers over deeper inequalities. The lack of uniforms does not create poverty nor does the presence of uniforms erase it. Instead, forced uniformity can breed resentment and reinforce a culture of suppression, where students lose opportunities to creatively express themselves and develop a sense of individuality. After all, most of us do not enter workplaces that require total uniformity, but rather expect to navigate and appreciate a spectrum of clothing choices, personalities, and perspectives.

Opponents may claim that uniforms reduce bullying, but studies on this topic are mixed at best. Bullying is a complex behavior rooted in more than just what a student wears. Banning uniforms compels schools to address the root causes—the need for better mental health support, counseling, and community-building—instead of settling for a cosmetic fix. Let us remember that eliminating visible markers neither ends discrimination nor does it cultivate empathy, understanding, or genuine inclusion.

Moreover, uniforms are an unnecessary barrier for many families. Many garment providers take advantage of mandatory policies to set high prices for specific school-branded clothing. For low-income families, the cost of uniforms adds up quickly, sometimes surpassing the cost of non-uniform clothing. This, ironically, exacerbates financial burdens rather than alleviating them. By allowing students the freedom to wear everyday clothing, we offer parents flexibility, affordability, and ease.

Freedom of expression is enshrined as a fundamental right in many societies, and dress is an essential part of that. The ability to choose how to present oneself is not mere superficiality: it’s a key aspect of psychological development, self-care, and social belonging. When we force uniforms, we stifle these developmental processes and risk raising a generation less confident in making personal choices or asserting their identity. Our schools should be spaces where students feel empowered to be themselves, explore their tastes, and learn the value of difference.

Let us also consider the practical drawbacks of enforcing uniforms. Students outgrow uniforms quickly, leading to waste and needless environmental impact. Uniforms may not account for cultural, religious, gender, or physical differences, putting certain students at discomfort or even in conflict with their identities. In the end, the supposed advantages of uniforms cannot outweigh the rich educational advantages of allowing self-expression, nor can they justify the exclusion or discomfort they may cause.

To conclude, banning school uniforms is not simply a matter of clothing—it is a stand for deeper principles: individuality over conformity, substance over appearance, and genuine inclusivity over superficial unity. Let us prepare students for a world where diversity is celebrated, not hidden; where voices are valued, not silenced; and where education fosters thinking individuals, not just obedient followers."
e97c1831-bf2a-418f-9418-eb5374789066,We should ban school uniforms,gpt-4.1,"Honorable judges, esteemed opponents, and valued audience members,

Today we gather to debate a matter that strikes at the very core of student welfare, individuality, and the purpose of our educational institutions. The motion before us is clear and urgent: we should ban school uniforms. I stand in firm affirmation, convinced that eliminating school uniforms not only upholds vital democratic values but also fosters an environment more conducive to learning, personal growth, and genuine equality.

Allow me to begin with a fundamental question: What is the primary purpose of education? It is, at its heart, to nurture young minds—not only academically, but socially and emotionally. Our schools must be spaces where students are encouraged to think critically, express themselves, and develop the confidence necessary for life beyond the classroom. Yet, school uniforms undermine all of these aims.

First and foremost, school uniforms suppress individuality. Adolescence is a critical phase where young people seek to understand and express who they are. Clothing is not merely about fashion; it is a powerful form of self-expression. When we force every student into identical attire, we send a subtle, yet significant, message: your uniqueness is less important than the institution’s comfort with conformity. Far from preparing students for the diversity of the real world, uniforms stifle their creativity and their ability to assert agency over their identities. Removing this barrier would empower students to develop their sense of self in a safe, supportive environment.

Secondly, school uniforms are often justified on the grounds of promoting equality, but in reality, they achieve the opposite. When policy makers prescribe a single, rigid uniform for all, we ignore the vast differences in body shapes, gender identities, cultural backgrounds, and economic means that exist among students. One-size-fits-all rarely fits all. Instead, uniforms can highlight inequalities—students who cannot afford new or well-fitting uniforms are stigmatized. For those whose gender identities do not align neatly with traditional uniform options, the requirement can become an everyday reminder of exclusion. Banning uniforms does not eliminate dress codes; it simply allows for flexibility, respecting both diversity and dignity, while still addressing concerns about appropriateness.

Furthermore, the argument that uniforms prevent bullying is, upon closer examination, deeply flawed. Bullying is not about clothing—it’s about power dynamics, emotional needs, and social structures. In reality, bullies do not need uniforms to target their peers; they will find new criteria, whether it’s about hair, speech, or interests. True solutions to bullying require teaching empathy and fostering inclusive cultures, not imposing superficial sameness.

Let us also consider the burden uniforms place on families. Uniforms are expensive—and they cannot be repurposed outside the school. For low-income families, buying specialty attire for growing children can be an undue financial strain. Some schools strictly enforce having multiple uniforms, compounding costs. In contrast, allowing students to wear their regular clothes reduces expenses, offers choice, and frees families from unnecessary financial pressures—particularly relevant during difficult economic times.

Moreover, let us not forget comfort and practicality. Students who are comfortable are better learners. Uniforms are often itchy, ill-fitting, and unsuitable for weather conditions. Allowing students some autonomy over what they wear ensures they arrive at school ready to engage fully, without distractions caused by physical discomfort.

Lastly, banning uniforms offers an invaluable opportunity to teach real-world skills—decision-making, responsibility, and respect for context. Students learn to make appropriate choices, balancing self-expression with social expectations—a lesson they will revisit throughout adulthood.

In conclusion, school uniforms are a well-intentioned but misguided policy."
863ef2a2-53e0-4a5b-86ea-aa8043a34479,We should ban factory farming,gpt-4.1,"Ladies and gentlemen, honorable judges, esteemed opponents, and audience members,

Today, we come together to debate a critical issue—one that lies at the intersection of ethics, environment, and society. The motion before us is clear and urgent: we should ban factory farming. I stand firmly in affirmation of this motion, and I invite you to consider the compelling evidence that demands we take decisive action against one of the gravest challenges of our time.

Let us begin by clarifying what we mean by factory farming. Factory farming refers to the large-scale, industrialized production of animals for food wherein the primary objective is to maximize output at the lowest possible cost. Animals are kept in confined, often inhumane conditions, frequently denied basic natural behaviors, and treated as mere units of production rather than sentient beings. The impact of this system reaches far beyond the confines of the farm—it invades our ethics, threatens our environment, endangers public health, and destabilizes economies.

First and foremost, we must address the profound ethical violations inherent in factory farming. It is morally indefensible to subject billions of sentient animals to suffering for the sake of cheap meat, eggs, and dairy. In these factories, animals are crammed by the thousands into spaces so small they cannot turn around, let alone engage in instinctive behaviors. They face mutilations without pain relief, and many are deprived of sunlight, fresh air, and dignity throughout their lives. The philosopher Jeremy Bentham famously asked, “The question is not, ‘Can they reason?’ nor, ‘Can they talk?’ but, ‘Can they suffer?’” Science tells us animals can and do suffer. As a society priding itself on compassion and justice, we cannot turn a blind eye to such systematic cruelty.

Second, the environmental devastation wrought by factory farming is both severe and far-reaching. According to the United Nations Food and Agriculture Organization, animal agriculture is responsible for more greenhouse gas emissions than the entire transportation sector. Factory farms produce vast lagoons of animal waste, which pollute our waterways, soil, and air, contributing to dead zones in oceans, toxic algal blooms, and the contamination of drinking water. The heavy use of land for feed crops accelerates deforestation and biodiversity loss on a global scale. It is no exaggeration to say that banning factory farming would be among the most effective steps we could take to combat climate change and preserve our planet for future generations.

Third, factory farming poses a significant threat to public health. The crowded, unsanitary conditions create breeding grounds for diseases. More alarmingly, the routine use of antibiotics to promote growth and prevent illness in these environments fuels the rise of antibiotic-resistant bacteria—a phenomenon the World Health Organization describes as one of the greatest threats to global health. Pandemic threats, such as avian and swine flu, also often originate in these industrialized settings. By banning factory farming, we take a stand against these ticking time bombs and protect the health of our communities.

Some might argue that factory farming is necessary to feed the world’s growing population. However, research consistently shows that more equitable, plant-based, and regenerative farming systems can meet global food demand without the unacceptable costs imposed by factory farms. Choosing sustainability does not mean choosing scarcity.

In conclusion, the evidence is overwhelming. Factory farming is indefensible—morally, environmentally, and medically. To ban it is not merely an act of compassion but one of necessity. We must transition toward food systems that honor animal welfare, protect public health, and sustain our living planet."
fec489ff-450e-41e8-8d9a-23858416e1c0,We should ban factory farming,gpt-4.1,"Ladies and gentlemen, esteemed judges, and honorable opponents,

Today we stand at a crossroads—one that tests not only our ethical compass, but also our collective vision for a sustainable, healthy, and just future. The motion before us is clear and urgent: we should ban factory farming. I stand resolutely in support of this motion, and I urge you to consider the profound and far-reaching consequences of allowing factory farming to persist in our society.

First, let us examine the most fundamental reason to ban factory farming: the abhorrent cruelty it inflicts on animals. Every year, billions of sentient beings—cows, pigs, chickens, and more—are subjected to conditions that can only be described as torture. Cramped cages, filthy sheds, mutilation without anesthesia, and a total lack of natural behaviors are hallmarks of factory farms. These animals are treated not as living beings, but as mere cogs in a profit-driven machine. Scientific research is unequivocal: animals experience pain, fear, and distress. By endorsing such suffering on an industrial scale, we compromise our own humanity. A ban on factory farming is not only an act of compassion—it is a moral imperative.

Second, factory farming is a ticking time bomb for public health. Overcrowding and unsanitary conditions serve as breeding grounds for disease. Seventy percent of antibiotics sold worldwide are administered to farm animals, not humans—a practice that encourages the rise of antibiotic-resistant superbugs. The World Health Organization has warned that these superbugs threaten to usher in a new era in which common infections are once again deadly. Furthermore, zoonotic diseases—viruses that jump from animals to humans—are more likely to emerge from factory farms. The COVID-19 pandemic has taught us the devastating cost of ignoring such risks. Continuing factory farming is simply playing Russian roulette with global health.

Third, the environmental devastation caused by factory farming is unparalleled. Livestock agriculture is responsible for more greenhouse gas emissions than all the world’s cars, planes, and trains combined. Factory farms are major drivers of deforestation, as vast swathes of rainforest are cleared to grow feed crops. They pollute our air and water with manure, toxic chemicals, and excess nutrients, leading to ecological dead zones and poisoning communities. At a time when the world recognizes the urgency of the climate crisis, to allow factory farming to continue is to undermine every effort to secure a livable planet for future generations.

Some may argue that factory farming is necessary to feed a growing population. But this is a false dichotomy. Studies show that alternative systems—such as plant-based agriculture, regenerative farming, and cellular agriculture—are rapidly advancing and can provide nutritious food at scale, using fewer resources and inflicting far less harm. Moreover, factory-farmed meat is artificially cheap, its true cost hidden by taxpayer subsidies and the environmental and health damages borne by society at large. By banning factory farming, we free ingenuity and investment to create a food system that is safer, fairer, and more sustainable.

Let us not forget the voices of small farmers, rural communities, and workers—many of whom suffer under the shadow of factory farming. These vast operations hollow out rural economies, drive down wages, and subject people to hazardous, dehumanizing labor conditions. Banning factory farming opens the door for revitalizing local agriculture, fostering resilient communities, and restoring pride and dignity to farming.

In conclusion, factory farming is indefensible on ethical, public health, environmental, and economic grounds. Banning it is not only feasible, but necessary if we are to fulfill our responsibilities as ethical citizens, stewards of the earth, and defenders of future generations. The time to act is now."
2da5d8cc-6848-4ad3-9ad7-015ad1882a18,We should abolish term limits,gpt-4.1,"Ladies and gentlemen, esteemed judges, honorable opponents, and attentive audience members: today, I stand in firm affirmation of the motion that we should abolish term limits.

At first blush, term limits may appear as a safeguard of democracy—an assurance that no single leader or legislator accumulates too much power for too long. Yet, behind this seemingly protective façade lies a host of unintended consequences, inhibiting effective governance, undermining the will of the people, and depriving our society of experienced, capable leadership. Let me detail why removing term limits strengthens, rather than weakens, our democratic institutions.

First and foremost, term limits inherently undermine the very foundation of democracy: the right of citizens to freely choose their representatives. When we impose arbitrary restrictions on how long a leader can serve, regardless of their performance or the will of the electorate, we send a clear message: we trust the system—but we do not trust the people. Consider this: if an elected official is effective, accountable, and deeply attuned to the needs of their community, why should the constituents be forbidden from re-electing that individual? Abolishing term limits empowers citizens, not politicians. It reaffirms our faith in voters to discern who should represent their interests, rather than mandating artificial turnover imposed from above.

Second, the experience and skills necessary for effective public service cannot be overstated. Governance, whether at the local or national level, is complex. Legislators and executives must understand intricate policy issues, build relationships, and navigate bureaucratic systems. Term limits forcibly remove seasoned leaders just as they reach their peak effectiveness, replacing them with individuals who require years to master the role—if at all. This “revolving door” not only disrupts the continuity of leadership but also cedes disproportionate influence to unelected actors, such as lobbyists and bureaucrats, who remain constant when elected officials are forced out. Eliminating term limits ensures that expertise, historical memory, and hard-earned relationships serve the interests of the public, rather than being squandered by arbitrary timelines.

Third, the accountability argument against abolishing term limits does not withstand scrutiny. Opponents claim term limits are essential to preventing corruption and entrenched power. But we must ask: is there truly no alternative to accountability besides forcibly ending public service? We already possess robust tools—free and fair elections, investigative journalism, independent judiciaries, and transparent oversight mechanisms—all of which provide ongoing checks against abuse. In truth, term limits can encourage riskier behavior, as officials with no prospect of re-election have less incentive to respond to constituents’ needs or resist special interest groups. When leaders are fully accountable to the electorate—knowing they can be voted in or out indefinitely—they are more likely to prioritize long-term public good over short-term gain.

Fourth, abolishing term limits encourages long-term planning and visionary leadership. When officials know their time is short, they may focus on immediate wins rather than tackling structural challenges—be it climate policy, economic reform, or education. Allowing leaders to serve as long as the public deems fit creates conditions where transformational progress is possible—projects that require years, even decades, to bear fruit. History has shown us that some of the most impactful reforms, both here and abroad, have been championed by those with the continuity and public trust to see them through.

Finally, term limits undermine representation from historically marginalized communities. Newcomers and underrepresented groups often require several election cycles to gain traction. Artificially induced turnover does not necessarily diversify our institutions; instead, it disrupts progress and perpetuates inequality by favoring those with inherited political networks and resources."
565c90c5-9bb7-48c5-95c6-53fd067da778,We should abolish term limits,gpt-4.1,"Honorable judges, esteemed opponents, and respected audience,

Today, I stand before you to firmly advocate for the abolition of term limits on elected officials. While term limits are often touted as safeguards against entrenched power and political stagnation, a closer examination reveals that they are, in fact, outdated constraints that undermine democracy, diminish accountability, and waste invaluable experience. Let us embrace a vision of governance that honors the sovereignty of the people, rewards effective leadership, and allows for true democratic choice.

First and foremost, abolishing term limits restores the fundamental principle of democracy: the power of the people to choose their leaders. Term limits, by their very nature, restrict voter rights by disqualifying experienced and possibly beloved leaders purely on the basis of tenure, not performance. Elections are—and should remain—the ultimate mechanism for accountability. If the electorate believes an official is no longer fit for office, they can and will remove that person through the ballot box. Imposing arbitrary terms, conversely, only serves to weaken the voice of the public and imply a lack of faith in their judgment. In a true democracy, the only legitimate term limit is the will of the people.

Second, termin limits often deprive government institutions of experience and continuity. Governance is a complex and demanding task, where expertise, relationships, and institutional memory are essential for crafting effective policy. When term limits force out skilled leaders, we lose this priceless reservoir of knowledge. Instead, we elevate political novices to positions of power, compounding inexperience with risk. By abolishing term limits, we allow effective leaders to continue serving, building on their successes and learning from their mistakes for the benefit of us all.

Moreover, the abrupt turnover caused by term limits too often shifts real influence into the hands of unelected individuals—lobbyists, bureaucrats, and staffers—who are not subject to direct voter scrutiny. When a seasoned leader departs, institutional knowledge doesn’t disappear; it transfers, frequently to those behind the scenes. This displacement undermines accountability, as unelected actors wield power without direct responsibility to the public. By abolishing term limits, we ensure that those in leadership are those the people have actually chosen, subject to regular electoral review.

It is also worth noting that term limits damage long-term policy planning and interfere with the pursuit of ambitious reforms. Visionary undertakings—whether in education, infrastructure, healthcare, or climate action—require years, if not decades, to realize. With rigid term limits, leaders are pressured to prioritize short-term wins over sustainable, transformative policies. As a result, crucial projects are derailed when leadership changes, with each new official seeking to put their own stamp on governance, leading to policy whiplash and institutional inconsistency.

Critics argue that term limits are necessary to prevent corruption and entrenchment. Yet evidence shows that corruption is not a function of time in office, but of weak institutions and lack of transparency. In fact, frequent turnover can facilitate corruption, as new officeholders are often less familiar with established safeguards and more susceptible to undue influence. The remedy, therefore, is not arbitrary term limits, but stronger transparency measures, robust oversight, and vigorous press freedom.

Finally, we must not forget the glaring double standard: in virtually every other field—be it medicine, law, science, or business—we understand the immense value of experience. No one would send an experienced surgeon into forced retirement simply because they’ve done their job well for a set period. In politics, as elsewhere, experience should be rewarded, not penalized."
935de92a-6c42-4baf-8451-578f984f2a70,We should ban telemarketing,gpt-4.1,"Ladies and gentlemen, esteemed judges, and worthy opponents,

Today, I stand firmly in support of the proposition: that we should ban telemarketing.

Let us begin by understanding what telemarketing truly is—a form of direct marketing where sales agents cold-call individuals, often at inconvenient times, to promote goods, services, or even dubious schemes. It is an intrusive practice that invades the sanctity of our private lives and is fundamentally disrespectful of personal boundaries.

First and foremost, telemarketing is a gross invasion of privacy. Our homes are our sanctuaries, places where we seek respite from the world. Yet, every day, millions of people experience the jarring interruption of unsolicited calls—sometimes multiple times a day. These calls do not merely disrupt dinner or disturb sleep; they are an unwelcome violation of personal space. No one consents to these interruptions, and the fact that one’s phone number is public or obtained by a company does not grant them the right to breach our peace. If someone came to your door every evening, uninvited, to sell you something, wouldn’t you have every right to repel them? The telephone should be no different.

Moreover, telemarketing has become an engine for widespread fraud and deception. According to the Federal Trade Commission, millions of dollars are lost annually due to telemarketing scams. Vulnerable populations—particularly the elderly—are specifically targeted. Scammers disguise themselves as charities, government agencies, or technical support, exploiting the trust and unfamiliarity of individuals. Behind each instance is not only the loss of money, but a loss of trust and a trail of emotional damage. Banning telemarketing would close off a critical channel used by fraudsters, thereby protecting our communities from harm.

In addition, telemarketing has a profoundly negative impact on mental health and well-being. Constant interruptions from telemarketing calls create an environment of stress and anxiety. For those working from home, caregivers, or people with disabilities, these unsolicited calls can be deeply distressing—disturbing essential routines and even causing harm when important communications are missed or confused with spam. The sheer persistence of robocalls—automated versions of telemarketing—leaves people feeling harassed, powerless, and exhausted.

Let us consider, too, the environmental and economic costs. Telemarketing relies not only on human labor but increasingly on vast digital infrastructure—automated dialing systems, servers, and databases—generating significant e-waste and consuming energy. Moreover, it is a highly inefficient business model. The vast majority of recipients do not wish to engage with telemarketers, resulting in wasted time, resources, and money. These resources could be better allocated to ethical, consensual marketing practices that respect consumer choice, such as opt-in email campaigns or content marketing.

Proponents of telemarketing may argue that it provides jobs and drives economic activity. However, the jobs created by telemarketing are often exploitative—low-wage, high-turnover positions associated with significant worker burnout. Transitioning to more ethical modes of marketing would not eliminate jobs but merely shift opportunities towards roles that are more respectful of both workers and consumers.

Regulation, as it stands, has failed. The existence of “do not call” lists, caller ID filters, and privacy laws has not stemmed the tide. Telemarketers find ways around these measures, and the proliferation of robocalls demonstrates a system out of control. Partial solutions cannot cure a practice so inherently flawed; only a complete ban can guarantee peace within our own homes.

In conclusion, telemarketing is an outdated, damaging, and inherently disrespectful means of marketing. It erodes privacy, enables theft, damages mental health, and wastes resources. We, as a society, must acknowledge that some lines should not be crossed in pursuit of profit."
ac4b79e8-056c-4da9-86dc-64b3ae872af0,We should ban telemarketing,gpt-4.1,"Honorable judges, esteemed opponents, and valued audience,

Today, I stand firmly in affirmation of the motion: “We should ban telemarketing.” This is not a call for incremental regulation—this is an urgent appeal for a total ban. Telemarketing is more than a nuisance; it is a systemic problem undermining consumer autonomy, personal privacy, and societal well-being.

Let us first consider the fundamental right to privacy. In our homes—in the supposed comfort and sanctity of our personal spaces—we expect to be free from unsolicited intrusion. Yet, telemarketing invades this space with relentless calls that interrupt meals, family time, and even our moments of rest. No one asks for these calls, and yet, we receive them—often multiple times per week, if not per day. Telemarketers harvest our phone numbers through shady practices, and they exploit loopholes in regulations to reach us. It is a violation not only of privacy but of consent, a value at the heart of any free society.

Next, let us address the issue of consumer exploitation. Telemarketing is not a level playing field. These calls are not neutral business opportunities; rather, they are techniques engineered to manipulate. Telemarketers use carefully scripted messages, high-pressure tactics, and psychological manipulations to push vulnerable individuals into purchases or decisions against their better judgment. The elderly and the less tech-savvy are especially at risk, falling prey to scams and fraudulent schemes that thrive in the telemarketing ecosystem. According to the Federal Trade Commission, millions lose money to telemarketing fraud every year. Are we content to let this continue? Or do we look those most vulnerable in the eye and say, “Enough is enough”?

Moreover, the economic argument for telemarketing is severely undermined by the rise of digital communication. The justification that telemarketing provides jobs and stimulates commerce is outdated. There are more effective, less invasive, and more ethical ways for businesses to advertise—email, social media, and opt-in SMS marketing, to name a few. These channels allow consumers to choose what type of communication they wish to receive, thus aligning business interests with consumer autonomy. Banning telemarketing would not erase jobs but redirect labor to more productive, consensual, and respectful forms of commerce.

Some will argue that regulations—such as “Do Not Call” lists—are sufficient. But enforcement is weak, exceptions abound (for surveys, charities, and political calls), and technology has outpaced legislation. Robocalls, spoofed numbers, and offshore call centers have made it nearly impossible for regulators to keep up. Telemarketing has outmaneuvered every patchwork reform policymakers have put in place. The only solution that truly respects the public’s right to peace and privacy is a decisive, categorical ban.

Consider also the impact on collective mental health. Constant interruptions erode focus, induce stress, and detract from our quality of life. In an age where attention is a precious commodity, telemarketing steals it without remorse. The cumulative wasted time and effort spent screening or answering irrelevant calls is enormous. We must ask ourselves: what values do we defend when we permit this invasion to persist? Is economic efficiency more important than dignity, autonomy, and well-being?

Ultimately, a ban on telemarketing is more than a policy choice—it is a moral imperative. It is a stand for the rights of consumers, the preservation of privacy, and the fostering of trust between business and society. By banning telemarketing, we send a message: that people matter more than inconvenience, that consent cannot be bought or ignored, and that in our society, respect for the individual prevails.

Honorable judges, let us not accept the status quo merely because it is familiar."
fbcc62d4-08cd-4af4-9f6c-750a8d08a6c6,We should end mandatory retirement,gpt-4.1,"Ladies and gentlemen, esteemed judges, and respected opponents,

Today, I stand before you to argue in unequivocal support of the motion: “We should end mandatory retirement.”

Let us begin by acknowledging the fundamental principle at the heart of this debate—autonomy. The right to work is not merely an economic privilege; it is a matter of dignity, purpose, and choice. Mandatory retirement policies, which force individuals out of the workforce purely because they have reached a certain age, violate this autonomy. They are based on an arbitrary number rather than an individual’s capabilities, desires, or unique contributions.

First, I want to address the notion of fairness and equality in the workplace. Mandatory retirement is, at its core, age discrimination. In nearly every other context, our societies rightly reject discrimination based on gender, race, or religion. Yet, when it comes to age, we enforce rules that strip experienced and skilled individuals of their livelihoods solely because they have reached a birthday milestone. This not only undermines principles of fairness but also perpetuates harmful stereotypes that older workers are less competent, less adaptable, or less valuable.

However, research consistently contradicts this stereotype. Studies across industries have shown that older employees often bring greater reliability, loyalty, problem-solving ability, and institutional knowledge. Eliminating mandatory retirement enables organizations to harness this wealth of experience, creating more diverse and multi-generational workplaces. Instead of arbitrarily discarding human capital, ending mandatory retirement empowers individuals to continue contributing as long as they are willing and able.

Secondly, let us consider the economic dimension. Our world is facing a demographic revolution. Populations are aging; life expectancies are increasing. Forcing capable individuals into retirement reduces our available workforce, exacerbates skill shortages, and places unnecessary strain on social security and pension systems. Allowing people to work longer—if they so choose—contributes to tax revenues, supports economic growth, and relieves the pressure on public resources. It is a pragmatic response to modern demographic realities.

Moreover, the personal impact of mandatory retirement is often deeply negative. Many individuals derive meaning, social connection, and structure from their work. Abruptly ending this connection can lead to loss of purpose, increased rates of depression, and even deteriorating physical health. We must recognize that not everyone is clamoring for a leisurely retirement. Some want—and need—to work. Ending mandatory retirement respects those personal circumstances and makes our society more compassionate and inclusive.

Now, one might argue that ending mandatory retirement could block opportunities for younger workers. However, this is based on the “lump of labor” fallacy—the mistaken belief that there is a fixed number of jobs to go around. In reality, retaining experienced employees often leads to greater organizational growth, mentorship opportunities for younger employees, and a more vibrant, skilled workplace. It is possible—and desirable—to have a workforce with both young and older individuals thriving alongside each other.

Furthermore, modern advancements in health and technology have fundamentally changed work. Many jobs depend more on knowledge and expertise than brute physical strength. Blanket rules based on age are increasingly obsolete. Instead, performance should be the measure of a person’s ability to work—not the date on their birth certificate.

In conclusion, mandatory retirement undermines individual liberty, perpetuates age-based discrimination, deprives society of valuable skills, and fails to reflect the realities of modern life. Rather than forcing people out, let us embrace the principle of choice: allow those who wish to continue working to do so, and support retirement as a personal decision, not a bureaucratic cutoff."
3a06a0a6-47e4-4ad8-aea5-05dc3292045b,We should end mandatory retirement,gpt-4.1,"Honorable judges, esteemed opponents, ladies and gentlemen,

Today we stand at the crossroads of tradition and progress, tasked with answering a crucial question: Should we maintain the practice of mandatory retirement, or is it time to end it once and for all? I stand firmly resolved that we should end mandatory retirement, and in my speech, I will show that abolishing this outdated policy will lead to greater fairness, improved productivity, and a more just and inclusive society.

First and foremost, let us be clear about what mandatory retirement means. It is the enforced removal of individuals from employment purely based on a specified age—often with no regard for their capability, performance, or desire to continue working. At its core, mandatory retirement is an institutionalized form of age discrimination. In almost every other context, we agree that employment decisions should be based on merit, performance, and capability, not on irrelevant personal characteristics such as race, gender, or indeed, age.

Let us consider the principle of fairness. In democratic societies, we pride ourselves on recognition of individual rights and the value of personal agency. Yet mandatory retirement blatantly contradicts these ideals by stripping competent and willing individuals of the right to determine the course of their own working lives. Many people reach the so-called ""retirement age"" bursting with passion, mental acuity, and drive. Forcing them to leave their profession simply because they have reached an arbitrary number is not only unfair, but a waste of talent and experience.

Indeed, this wastefulness brings us to the economy. Human capital is the most valuable resource any society possesses. When we forcibly remove the most experienced and knowledgeable members from our workforce, we drain organizations of wisdom, leadership, and mentorship. Older workers are repositories of institutional memory—guiding younger colleagues, sharing skills that cannot be downloaded, and providing continuity in times of change. In sectors like medicine, education, engineering, and the arts, the premature exit of such individuals impoverishes the entire field and stifles innovation.

Our world is changing. Advances in healthcare and lifestyle have extended both life expectancy and the duration of productive, healthy years. For many, the so-called golden years are more active and engaged than ever before. The idea that everyone suddenly becomes unfit for work at a set age is simply outdated. Instead, we must embrace flexible solutions, recognizing that the ability and desire to work are deeply individual matters—not ones to be dictated by an inflexible policy.

Furthermore, with societies aging rapidly across much of the world, we face unprecedented challenges to pension systems, social welfare, and economic growth. Allowing willing and able individuals to continue working alleviates pressure on public finances and sustains economic dynamism. It also supports the dignity and independence of older workers, reduces the risk of poverty, and promotes intergenerational solidarity.

My opponents may argue that mandatory retirement makes way for younger workers. But this is a false dichotomy. Studies in economics have debunked the so-called ""lump of labor fallacy""—the mistaken belief that there are only so many jobs, so older workers must make way for the young. In fact, experienced workers contribute to overall growth, create new opportunities, and foster mentorship that boosts the prospects of younger colleagues.

Ending mandatory retirement is not about forcing anyone to work forever; it is about choice. It is about trust—trusting individuals to know when the time is right for them to retire. Performance standards, health assessments, or voluntary retirement programs can easily address genuine needs for transition—without the blunt instrument of automatic dismissal.

In closing, we must move beyond traditions that limit our potential."
a246074f-ddd0-4c87-8340-2ca54ed154c2,We should abandon television,gpt-4.1,"Ladies and gentlemen, honorable judges, esteemed opponents, and fellow audience members—today, I stand before you to make the case for a transformative proposition: that we, as a society, should abandon television. This is not a radical call to destroy our screens or erase decades of storytelling, but rather a clarion call to reconsider the outsized role television plays in our lives and to acknowledge the profound benefits of moving beyond its grip.

Let’s begin by recognizing the immense shift in our information environment. In its early days, television opened windows to the world, democratizing access to news, education, and entertainment. But what was once a marvel has become a menace. The time has come to recognize that its negative impacts now vastly outweigh the good it once served.

First, television is a passive medium that encourages consumption over creation. The average adult spends more than three hours a day watching TV—a staggering figure that equates to over a thousand hours annually. Imagine what we could achieve—from learning a new language to mastering an instrument, from building stronger relationships to engaging with our communities—if we reclaimed even half that time for active pursuits.

Second, television distorts our perception of reality. Designed not to inform, but to attract and retain viewership, television often sacrifices accuracy and truth for spectacle and ratings. News channels resort to sensationalism. Reality shows manufacture drama. Advertisers manipulate our desires and build inescapable expectations. The result is a society increasingly distanced from the truth, where vital issues are simplified to sound bites and deep thought is replaced by instant gratification.

Third, television isolates rather than unites. Some argue that a favorite show can be a communal experience—but how often do we truly engage with one another while watching? Contrast this with the bonds formed through collaborative activities such as reading together, playing games, or sharing meals without the constant background of flashing lights and canned laughter. Television traps us in solitary consumption, even in the company of others, reducing meaningful connection to fleeting comments about plots and characters.

Moreover, television is detrimental to our health: physically, mentally, and emotionally. Hours spent sedentary in front of screens have been linked to obesity, cardiovascular disease, and impaired cognitive development—especially in children. Studies increasingly show links between extensive television viewing and anxiety, depression, and even poor academic achievement. Instead of encouraging curiosity, exploration, and critical thinking, television all too often dulls our senses and narrows our world.

Now, some may argue that television is a source of high-quality documentaries, gripping dramas, and important news. But let’s be honest: in the internet age, all of this—and more—is available through more interactive, customizable, and educational platforms. When we rely on television, we subject ourselves to passive programming and the tyranny of the schedule. When we move beyond it, we seize control over what we learn, how we are entertained, and what we value.

Abandoning television is not about refusing entertainment or rejecting technology. It is about reclaiming our time, our relationships, our mental health, and our ability to engage with the real world—not the manufactured world behind the glass. It is about fostering creativity, curiosity, and connection—values that television, despite its promises, too often fails to deliver.

In conclusion, let us be bold enough to let go of this outdated medium. Let us refuse to be mere spectators in our own lives. The world is out there—vivid, unscripted, and endlessly rewarding. It’s time we put down the remote, turn off the television, and step back into reality. Thank you."
ded983d6-cf68-45c4-b85c-ac9c00057eac,We should abandon television,gpt-4.1,"Ladies and gentlemen, esteemed judges, and worthy opponents,

Today, I stand before you to argue in favour of a bold yet necessary idea: that we, as a society, should abandon television. In this era defined by information, connection, and rapid change, maintaining television as a dominant medium not only holds us back, but actively harms our personal, social, and cultural wellbeing. Allow me to outline why it is time to bid goodbye to television, for the benefit of ourselves and the generations to come.

First, let us consider the profound impact television has on our mental and physical health. Numerous studies have shown a strong correlation between television consumption and negative health outcomes. Sitting passively for hours in front of a screen encourages sedentary lifestyles, contributing to the global rise in obesity, diabetes, and cardiovascular disease. Mentally, television exposes us to a barrage of sensationalized news and manipulative advertising, while the constant flicker of images and sound disrupts sleep patterns, especially in children and teenagers. These health consequences are not speculative—they are supported by decades of scientific research. If we truly care about the wellbeing of our society, removing television from our daily routines is an essential step.

Second, television undermines our capacity for critical thinking. Television programming, by design, aims for mass appeal, often trading depth and nuance for simplicity and spectacle. News is distilled into soundbites, opinions are polarized, and complex issues are boiled down to binary debates. Viewers become passive recipients, rather than active participants, in the information they consume. Contrast this with reading—a process that requires imagination, attention, and reflection. Or with interactive digital content, which allows for independent verification of facts and diverse perspectives. By abandoning television, we free ourselves from the intellectual shallows, and reclaim our ability to engage critically with the world.

Third, television weakens family bonds and community engagement. The flickering screen, often situated at the center of our homes, draws people away from shared activities—conversation, outdoor recreation, collective meals. Hours spent in silence before the TV are hours not spent building relationships, learning from elders, or creating memories. Communities, too, suffer when television becomes the substitute for civic participation. Instead of attending local events, joining discussions, or volunteering, people retreat into their living rooms, isolated by programming designed to grab attention rather than foster connection. Abandoning television would restore spaces and opportunities for genuine human interaction, strengthening the fabric of society.

Fourth, television perpetuates stereotypes, misinformation, and consumerism. Much of mainstream programming is shaped by corporate interests, reinforcing narrow standards of beauty, success, and happiness. Advertising, inseparable from television, manipulates desires and distorts priorities. News coverage often amplifies fear and division, rather than fostering understanding. By accepting television as a filter through which we view the world, we allow ourselves to be shaped by the agendas of others, instead of forming our own. To abandon television is, fundamentally, to reclaim agency over our minds, values, and perceptions.

Finally, the technological landscape has shifted. The internet offers on-demand access to quality information, meaningful entertainment, and diverse voices. If we seek to be informed citizens, thoughtful consumers, or creative individuals, we no longer need to rely on the passive, one-way transmission of ideas that television represents. Instead, we can choose engagement, diversity, and depth. By putting down the remote, we open doors to richer alternatives that empower us, rather than numb us.

In conclusion, television may have played a significant role in the past, but today, it stands as an obstacle to healthier bodies, sharper minds, stronger connections, and truer understanding."
8dae180f-ce73-42da-8c5c-6b372be4c849,Casinos should be banned,gpt-4.1,"Honorable judges, esteemed opponents, and respected audience,

Today, we stand firmly resolved that casinos should be banned. The crux of this debate transcends mere economics or personal freedoms; it delves into the heart of societal well-being, moral responsibility, and the undeniable evidence of harm inflicted by casinos. Let us not be distracted by glittering facades or promises of short-term gains. Instead, let us examine the reality: casinos are predatory institutions that undermine public health, corrode social fabric, and exacerbate economic inequality.

First and foremost, casinos are engineered to exploit human vulnerability. They thrive on gambling addiction, a recognized psychological disorder that the casino industry fuels and profits from. According to the National Council on Problem Gambling, around 2–3% of American adults meet the criteria for problem gambling. What does that mean in practice? It means lives ruined, families torn apart, and individuals driven to the brink of despair. The architecture, the sounds, the lighting—all are meticulously designed to entice people to lose self-control, to chase losses, and to return again, and again, and again. Should we, as a society, condone an industry that profits from fostering addiction, no less severe and damaging than addiction to drugs or alcohol?

Some may argue that adults should be free to make their own choices. Yet, do we tolerate products solely on the basis of individual choice when their net effect harms society? We regulate or ban dangerous substances, unsafe products, and toxic habits for the public good. Indeed, government intervention is warranted when personal choices produce devastating social costs. Gambling addiction results not just in financial ruin, but also in increased crime, mental illness, suicide, and broken families. The ripple effects are profound—the spouses and children left behind, the increased demand on social services, the loss of workplace productivity. These costs far outweigh any perceived benefits from “individual freedom.”

Supporters of casinos often point to economic benefits: job creation, tourism, and boosted tax coffers. Yet, study after study shows that the purported economic boom is a mirage. The vast majority of casino revenue comes from local residents, not tourists. Money spent in casinos is money not spent on local businesses, restaurants, or family activities. For every job created, others are often lost in the broader community—gambling does not build wealth, it merely redistributes it, often flowing from the most vulnerable to the already wealthy casino operators. Furthermore, casinos generate significant societal costs, as communities bear the burden of increased addiction, bankruptcy, and crime. One meta-analysis showed that for every dollar in casino tax revenue, there is a corresponding social cost of up to three dollars. This is not sound economics; it is a reckless social experiment where common citizens pay the price.

We must also confront the moral dimension. Casinos deliberately target those least able to afford losses—the elderly, low-income families, and those lured by the false hope of instant riches. They deploy aggressive marketing, offer enticing credit, and prey on desperation and loneliness. Are these the values we wish to endorse and perpetuate as a society? Our laws and institutions should protect the vulnerable, not exploit them for profit.

In closing, the evidence is overwhelming: casinos cause more harm than good. They foster addiction, erode family and community cohesion, drain local economies, and undermine our collective moral responsibility. Banning casinos is not an act of paternalistic overreach, but a necessary step to safeguard the health, prosperity, and ethical foundations of our society. Let us choose people over profit, compassion over exploitation, and the long-term well-being of our communities over the fleeting allure of a rigged jackpot.

Thank you."
9f26dd00-8939-4d0d-8d9d-9e7558190038,Casinos should be banned,gpt-4.1,"Ladies and gentlemen, honorable judges, esteemed opponents, and distinguished audience members,

Today, I stand before you to firmly affirm the motion: Casinos should be banned. The prospect of banning casinos is not simply a question of restricting entertainment, but a critical moral, social, and economic decision that can profoundly shape our society for the better. Let us examine, in detail, why the proliferation of casinos is a threat to individuals, families, and communities, and why an outright ban is a necessary and justifiable course of action.

First and foremost, casinos are fundamentally built on the exploitation of human weaknesses. The very business model of gambling establishments relies not on entertainment, but on the well-documented, scientifically proven vulnerabilities of human psychology—vulnerabilities that lead to addiction. While casual gambling is often portrayed as harmless fun, the stark reality is that a significant proportion of casino profits come from problem gamblers—those who cannot control their impulses, who chase losses, and who fall into cycles of destructive behavior. According to the World Health Organization, gambling disorder is now classified as a mental health condition, with devastating consequences for mental and physical well-being. Casinos do not protect these individuals; they entrap them, profit from them, and often catalyze their financial and emotional ruin.

Secondly, the impact of casinos extends far beyond the individual level, eroding families and communities at their core. Gambling addiction does not exist in isolation. It leads to the breakdown of relationships, divorce, domestic violence, child neglect, and, in the gravest cases, criminal activity. The ripple effect of a single gambler’s losses is felt by spouses, children, friends, and even strangers—requiring public intervention, social services, and legal remedies. Studies have shown that areas with high concentrations of casinos experience increases in crime rates—not just theft and fraud, but violent crime as well. The supposed financial benefits touted by the casino industry pale in comparison to the enormous social costs they generate—costs that we, as a society, are forced to bear.

Let us also address the economic argument, often advanced by casino proponents, that these establishments are engines of job creation, tourism, and fiscal gain. The truth is far more complex and far less flattering. Casinos create some low-wage, precarious employment, but they also siphon disposable income away from local businesses—restaurants, shops, and other community services—which suffer as gambling drains wallets and rooms fill with slot machines instead of families. The much-vaunted “tax revenue” is, in fact, often offset by increased expenditure on policing, addiction treatment, and social support systems. In many communities, the money that flows into casinos does not circulate, but disappears—lining the pockets of multinational corporations rather than contributing to local prosperity.

Ethically speaking, we must also question the role of a civil society: Should our governments be in the business of facilitating and legitimizing predatory industries? By allowing casinos to operate, we endorse the normalization of behavior that damages the moral and social fabric of the nation. We tacitly approve of preying on the poorest and most vulnerable, of advertising false hopes and easy riches, of exchanging community well-being for fleeting fiscal gain.

In closing, banning casinos is not an attack on personal freedom or a denial of individual choice. It is a calculated stand for public welfare, for ethical responsibility, and for the protection of our most vulnerable citizens. It is a commitment to prioritizing health, family stability, and the common good over the interests of profit-driven enterprises. The evidence is overwhelming; the stakes are too high to ignore. Let us not gamble with our future."
83b8924c-b96c-46dc-8ef3-3116083e3f74,We should fight urbanization,gpt-4.1,"Honourable judges, esteemed opponents, and distinguished audience,

Today, we stand at a crossroads. The topic before us is more than a matter of geography or construction—it is a question of values, sustainability, and the future of our planet. The motion is clear: ""We should fight urbanization."" I rise to affirm this motion, and I urge each of you to consider not just the convenience of urban life, but the profound costs that unchecked urbanization inflicts upon our societies, our environment, and our very humanity.

Let us begin by acknowledging what urbanization means. It is not simply the growth of cities, but the relentless march of populations away from rural lands into sprawling, congested metropolises. It is the transformation of once-thriving villages into deserted landscapes, while our cities balloon, often beyond their capacity.

Why should we fight urbanization? There are three fundamental reasons: its devastating impact on the environment, its corrosion of social fabric and individual well-being, and its economic pitfalls.

First, consider the environment. The evidence is unequivocal: urbanization is a primary engine of biodiversity loss, deforestation, and pollution. As cities expand, green spaces collapse beneath concrete, and wildlife habitats are erased. The UN reports that urban areas consume over two-thirds of the world’s energy and produce more than 70% of global carbon emissions. Air pollution chokes our lungs; rivers are polluted by runoff; and heat islands raise temperatures, exacerbating climate change. Urbanization may offer short-term growth, but it sabotages our planet’s long-term health. To allow urbanization to advance unchecked is to betray our duty to future generations.

Second, urbanization erodes our social fabric and damages mental health. Traditional communities offer interconnectedness, shared values, and support systems. When people are uprooted and herded into cities, social bonds are severed. The result is a crisis of loneliness and alienation. Studies link urban living with increased rates of anxiety, depression, and stress-related disorders. Neighbourhoods become anonymous; people become isolated. And what of the elderly, the vulnerable, and the poor? They are often left behind, or else swallowed by the indifference and anonymity of urban environments that value productivity over humanity.

Third, let us consider the economic argument. The promise of prosperity often drives people to urban centres, but this is a false promise for many. As millions flood into cities in search of opportunity, the realities they face are crushing: unaffordable housing, joblessness, and the growth of sprawling slums. According to UN-Habitat, one in every four urban residents lives in slum conditions, deprived of access to basic services. Urban economies breed stark inequalities, with the wealthy enjoying privilege while millions toil in informal, precarious labour. Far from being engines of inclusion, cities can ricochet individuals into a cycle of poverty and marginalization.

Some may argue that cities foster innovation and growth. But do we want a world where innovation comes at the cost of human dignity and environmental destruction? Technological progress need not be tethered to ever-expanding urban centres. Through investment in rural areas, the spread of digital infrastructure, and promotion of sustainable small towns, we can unleash the creativity and ambition of people everywhere, not only in cramped city blocks.

The question, therefore, is not whether urbanization has benefits. It is whether those benefits outweigh the harms. The answer, I submit, is no. We must fight urbanization—not by shutting down cities, but by resisting the mindless expansion, by investing in rural renewal, by enabling communities to thrive where they are, and by pursuing forms of development that respect both people and planet.

In conclusion, to fight urbanization is to stand for sustainability, community, and a balanced future."
0bcb5c28-c3f7-47b6-be68-f8aebc5c991f,We should fight urbanization,gpt-4.1,"Honourable judges, esteemed opponents, and respected audience,

Today, I stand before you to advocate firmly and unequivocally for the motion: “We should fight urbanization.”

In our world’s march towards progress, urbanization is often lauded as a symbol of modernity, innovation, and economic growth. But beneath its glossy veneer lies a host of problems that threaten not only the environment but also the very fabric of our societies, our health, and our future security. I will demonstrate that fighting urbanization is not an act of nostalgia or resistance to modernity—it is an urgent imperative to secure a sustainable, equitable, and healthy world.

Let us begin with the environmental costs. Urbanization is the leading driver of habitat destruction. Every day, forests are felled, wetlands are drained, and agricultural lands are swallowed to make way for expanding cities. The World Wildlife Fund reports that we are losing natural habitats at a staggering rate, much of it to urban sprawl. This directly threatens biodiversity, pushing countless species to extinction. By fighting urbanization, we aren’t just stopping construction—we are safeguarding irreplaceable ecosystems, preserving one of humanity’s greatest assets: a rich and diverse natural world.

Second, urbanization is at the heart of our planet’s climate crisis. Cities occupy merely 3% of the Earth’s surface, yet they consume over two-thirds of the world’s energy and produce more than 70% of global carbon emissions, according to the United Nations. Fighting urbanization is thus synonymous with fighting climate change. A decentralized human society—in which growth is balanced, and development is dispersed—means fewer cars clogging the roads, less concrete soaking up heat, more green spaces for carbon capture, and a smaller ecological footprint per capita.

But environmental damage is only one side of the coin. Urbanization comes with dire social consequences. The promise of urban opportunity has led to mass rural-to-urban migration, fracturing communities and family structures in the search for elusive city jobs. The result? Overcrowded slums, a surge in homelessness, and a skyrocketing cost of living that locks millions out of decent housing and basic services. Urban poverty, rather than rural hardship, is now one of the world’s greatest challenges. By fighting urbanization, we stem the tide of inequality, champion investment in rural infrastructure, and promote local economies—ensuring that prosperity does not come at the cost of social cohesion and human dignity.

Let us also consider public health. The COVID-19 pandemic has made it alarmingly clear: high-density cities are breeding grounds for communicable diseases. Crowded living conditions, inadequate sanitation, and polluted air exacerbate risks not just for pandemics, but also for chronic diseases such as asthma and cardiovascular illness. Contrast this with rural or peri-urban environments—spaces where social distancing is a reality, not a policy, and where the air and water are cleaner. To fight urbanization is to invest in the long-term health and resilience of societies as a whole.

Opponents will argue that cities are the engines of economic growth, cultural innovation, and technological advance. But is relentless agglomeration the only path forward? History and current events teach us otherwise. Technological advances like remote work, e-commerce, and digital communication make it increasingly possible to live outside of urban centers without sacrificing opportunity. If we redirect investment towards rural broadband, healthcare, and education, we unlock the potential of smaller towns and villages, revitalizing areas that have too long been neglected.

In conclusion, to fight urbanization is not to wish for an end to progress—it is to demand a better, fairer, and more sustainable kind of progress."
b03c71c7-8440-42cf-84b2-0416156d0ce1,We should cancel pride parades,gpt-4.1,"Ladies and gentlemen, honorable judges, esteemed opposition, and valued audience: Today we stand to affirm the motion, ""We should cancel pride parades."" Before proceeding, let me stress that this debate is not about denying anyone’s right to love, to be, or to express their identity. Rather, it is about questioning whether the institution of pride parades, as they exist today, serve their intended purpose—or whether they have, in fact, outlived their usefulness, generated new and serious problems, and warrant reconsideration in modern society.

Allow me to present three core pillars supporting our stance: the evolution of societal context, the preservation of inclusivity, and the pursuit of genuine systemic progress.

First: The Evolution of Societal Context.  
Pride parades once played a vital and urgent role. In decades past, LGBTQ+ people faced hostile laws, violence, and almost total erasure in public life. Parades were acts of courageous defiance, essential to visibility, carving out space in a world hellbent on exclusion. However, the landscape has shifted dramatically. Today, in much of the world—certainly in the societies where pride parades are most prominent—legal rights have expanded, attitudes have softened, and LGBTQ+ culture is present and celebrated across media, politics, and the arts. Many of the foundational victories pride parades fought for have been realized. While not claiming that bigotry has vanished, we must ask: Have pride parades moved from engines of progress to relics of a struggle largely won? Should our continued focus rest upon parades—which often center on spectacle and celebration—rather than the pressing, nuanced battles still to be fought in policy, education, and support for marginalized sub-groups within the LGBTQ+ community?

Second: The Preservation of Inclusivity.  
While pride parades claim the banner of inclusivity, their modern iteration often serves the opposite. What began as grassroots demonstrations for equality have morphed into commercialized, corporate-sponsored spectacles. Global brands, politicians, and celebrities vie for presence—not necessarily out of solidarity, but for marketing opportunity. This corporatization distorts the movement, peddling sanitized versions of pride stripped of radical advocacy or intersectionality. Moreover, many in the LGBTQ+ community—especially people of color, low-income individuals, trans folks, and those with disabilities—feel more alienated than welcomed, marginalized by both internal dynamics and the external gaze of onlookers. Large, public parades can also become spaces rife with substance abuse, oversexualization, and risky behavior—all elements that not only perpetuate negative stereotypes but actively discomfort participants and bystanders, further eroding the cause’s authenticity. In this new landscape, does the pride parade as we know it truly serve inclusivity, or does it merely present a façade, a commodified, one-size-fits-all masquerade?

Third: The Pursuit of Genuine Systemic Progress.  
Perhaps most crucially, pride parades risk supplanting the fight for real change with hollow symbolism. We have witnessed a troubling transition from grassroots activism to a festive event, more akin to a party than a protest, and with it, a corresponding stagnation of substantive progress. Oppression, discrimination, and violence—particularly against transgender people and LGBTQ+ communities of color—persist at alarming rates. Rather than annual parades, what our society requires is sustained, difficult work: legislative advocacy, educational reform, and comprehensive support services. These are not achieved through confetti and floats, but through serious engagement, policymaking, and coalition-building—efforts that the pride parade’s pageantry may distract from or even trivialize in the public eye.

In summary, while pride parades were once necessary beacons of hope and resistance, their effectiveness, inclusivity, and virtue have waned in today’s context."
8eba24b4-823e-4010-ac28-b01fc121fbed,We should cancel pride parades,gpt-4.1,"Ladies and gentlemen, esteemed judges, and honored opponents,

Today, I stand before you to argue in favor of the motion: We should cancel pride parades. At first glance, this proposal may seem controversial, even provocative. But tonight, I invite you to look beyond assumptions and consider the deeper implications — not only for LGBTQ+ communities, but for society as a whole.

Let me be clear: This debate is not about denying anyone’s rights, dignity, or self-expression. It is not about erasing the history of the LGBTQ+ movement or the vital progress achieved through decades of courageous activism. Rather, it is about assessing whether pride parades, as they are practiced today, serve the most constructive role in furthering equality, fostering social harmony, and advancing the values of inclusivity in our diverse societies.

Let us begin with the origins and intentions behind Pride. Pride parades emerged as acts of resistance — powerful, urgent responses to oppression and invisibility. In that context, public displays of solidarity and protest were essential. However, in many regions around the world today, the landscape has changed. Legal, social, and cultural recognition of LGBTQ+ rights has advanced significantly in much of the Western world. In this shift, pride parades have evolved — and it is this evolution that demands our scrutiny.

My first point is that pride parades, as they now stand, often undermine the very goals they once championed by deepening divisions rather than bridging them. Rather than fostering understanding, parades have, in many places, devolved into spectacles associated with exhibitionism, excessive commercialism, and exclusive subcultural signaling. What was once a movement for acceptance has, in some cases, become a festival that excludes those who do not conform to specific norms of LGBTQ+ expression. This alienates not only mainstream society, but also many within the LGBTQ+ community itself: individuals who feel uncomfortable with the public conduct, the lack of family-friendliness, or the overemphasis on specific forms of sexuality.

Secondly, pride parades can inadvertently feed backlash and entrench prejudice. The overt and flamboyant nature of some parades may foster stereotypes and resentment among segments of society that are not yet fully accepting — or are only beginning to open their minds. Rather than creating dialogue, such displays risk reinforcing harmful caricatures and providing ammunition to critics who claim LGBTQ+ communities are forcing their lifestyles in a manner incongruent with social mores. If our goal is inclusion, should we not prioritize approaches which invite engagement rather than inflame opposition?

Thirdly, let us consider the environmental and logistical impacts. Large-scale parades require immense resources: city budgets stretched, public services diverted, neighborhoods disrupted, and tons of waste generated. At a time when communities are urged to be environmentally conscious and fiscally responsible, we must ask if parades are the best, or even necessary, method of celebration and advocacy.

Furthermore, the corporate takeover of pride events cannot be ignored. What started as grassroots activism has, in many cases, become a marketing opportunity for large companies eager to brandish rainbow logos for profit, rather than genuine support for LGBTQ+ rights. This commercialization dilutes the original message and trivializes the struggle, turning a rights movement into a commodified spectacle.

In conclusion, the cancellation of pride parades does not mean the silencing or disappearance of LGBTQ+ voices. On the contrary, it presents an opportunity to reimagine advocacy in ways that are more inclusive, more dialogical, and more effective in dismantling prejudice. Let us redirect our energies towards community-building, grassroots engagement, and education — towards efforts that foster authentic solidarity rather than fleeting displays."
ca0425ad-1942-4629-836e-c969aadea688,We should prohibit unisex bathrooms,gpt-4.1,"Honorable judges, esteemed opponents, and valued audience,

Today, we stand before you to argue the motion, “We should prohibit unisex bathrooms.” This is not simply a question of modernity or tradition, convenience or inconvenience. It is, at its core, a matter of public safety, privacy, and the protection of vulnerable populations. Our stance arises from a genuine concern for societal well-being and the need to ensure safe, comfortable public spaces for everyone.

First, let us address the issue of privacy—an essential right upheld and cherished in all societies. Traditionally, bathrooms have been divided by gender for a reason: individuals wish to fulfill private, sensitive needs without fear of exposure or embarrassment. Unisex bathrooms erode these boundaries. For many, especially women, children, and the elderly, the prospect of sharing intimate facilities with members of the opposite sex is uncomfortable at best and distressing at worst. Privacy is not a matter of preference; it is foundational to human dignity and basic decency. No one should be forced to compromise this dignity for the sake of administrative or architectural convenience.

Second, and perhaps even more crucial, is the question of safety. While the majority of people are respectful and law-abiding, it would be naive to disregard the unfortunate reality that public spaces can pose risks—especially to women and children. A multitude of cases, documented across multiple nations, show that shared bathroom spaces have occasionally been exploited by individuals seeking to harass, assault, or otherwise endanger others. Separate bathrooms create a minimal but crucial barrier against such misconduct, providing a layer of protection that unisex facilities simply cannot guarantee. If even a single individual is harmed as a result of lowered barriers, is the price not too high?

Moreover, let us recognize that the mere perception of risk can be as detrimental as risk itself. According to several surveys, a majority of women report discomfort or even fear at the prospect of sharing bathrooms with men. This anxiety is not unfounded, but rooted in well-documented gender-based disparities in physical safety. Should we prioritize a theoretical gesture of inclusivity over the lived concerns of half our population?

Furthermore, prohibiting unisex bathrooms does not preclude us from making accommodations for those who feel uncomfortable in binary-gendered spaces. Targeted solutions—such as well-monitored, single-occupancy, gender-neutral restrooms—offer privacy, dignity, and accessibility without subjecting the majority to undue discomfort or risk. These specialized facilities can and should exist alongside gender-specific restrooms, offering options to those who need them without dismantling safeguards for everyone else.

Let us also consider the societal impact on children and adolescents. In formative years, young people often struggle with body image, confidence, and social pressures. Unisex bathrooms can amplify these insecurities and even expose young people to inappropriate situations. Many parents have voiced concern regarding the lack of boundaries in unisex spaces, fearing for their children’s emotional and physical well-being. Why should we ignore parental concerns—the bedrock of community trust—when safer, compromise solutions are readily available?

In conclusion, while advocates of unisex bathrooms may appeal to ideals of inclusivity and efficiency, these aspirations cannot outweigh the concrete rights to privacy, safety, and dignity that separate bathrooms protect. The rare logistical challenges of maintaining gender-specific restrooms pale in comparison to the potential risks—both present and perceived—posed by shared spaces. 

Let us not allow convenience or trendy rhetoric to override established norms that protect our most vulnerable. By prohibiting unisex bathrooms, we affirm our commitment to safe, comfortable, and respectful public spaces for all citizens. Thank you."
ff799dc2-68ca-4da7-87ce-041c9e07d605,We should prohibit unisex bathrooms,gpt-4.1,"Ladies and gentlemen, honorable judges, esteemed opponents, and valued audience members,

Today, I rise to defend the proposition that we should prohibit unisex bathrooms. This is not a stance rooted in intolerance or ignorance, but one anchored in serious concerns for privacy, safety, and the preservation of social norms built over decades for the benefit of vulnerable populations. Our discussion is not about denying anyone dignity. Rather, it is about ensuring that the spaces we all share respect personal boundaries and minimize risk for every citizen.

First and foremost, let’s address the issue of safety. Bathrooms, by their private nature, are unfortunately one of the few public spaces where individuals, especially women and children, are particularly vulnerable to harassment, assault, or even exploitation. Statistics consistently show that women are at a higher risk of being victims of sexual harassment and assault—a risk that is exacerbated when private spaces are made accessible to all genders without oversight. The introduction of unisex bathrooms undermines the barriers of protection which single-sex bathrooms provide, opening the door—sometimes literally—to individuals with malicious intent, who may exploit the permissiveness of these facilities.

This concern is not hypothetical. In jurisdictions where unisex bathrooms have been introduced, there have been documented cases of men exploiting these mixed-gender arrangements to harass women. Regardless of intention, when we create spaces where anyone can enter at any time, we erode the sense of safety that single-sex bathrooms provide, particularly to women and children. By maintaining gender-segregated restrooms, we deliver a powerful message: your safety and peace of mind are valued and protected.

Secondly, privacy is a fundamental human right. Our laws, customs, and etiquette have, for decades, recognized the particular sensitivity around bathroom use. Unisex bathrooms inherently erode privacy, forcing individuals—many of whom may feel uncomfortable or even unsafe undressing or performing personal hygiene in the presence of the opposite sex—to compromise their comfort and dignity. This concern is especially acute for those from cultures or religious backgrounds that hold strong views regarding modesty and gender separation. To mandate unisex bathrooms is to privilege one group’s comfort over another’s discomfort, and, in doing so, to marginalize those who already feel vulnerable in public spaces.

Let us also consider the psychological impact on children and teenagers. For young people, the process of developing self-confidence and maintaining healthy boundaries is complex. Forcing them into unisex bathrooms before they are comfortable can have lasting—and largely negative—consequences. The mere anticipation of having to share intimate spaces with the opposite sex can generate anxiety, embarrassment, and a reluctance to use school or public restrooms altogether, leading to adverse health effects.

Moreover, the administrative and practical challenges posed by unisex bathrooms should not be dismissed. Increased incidents of misuse, higher cleaning and maintenance costs due to a wider range of needs, and the potential for longer queues undermine efficiency and contribute to negative experiences with public infrastructure. These bathrooms also make it considerably more difficult to enforce rules regarding appropriate behavior, as distinguishing between legitimate use and potential misconduct is no longer as clear-cut.

Finally, the argument persists that unisex bathrooms are necessary for some individuals. We believe accommodating those needs is laudable, but not at the expense of the majority’s safety, privacy, and comfort. Instead, institutions can provide a limited number of single-occupancy, gender-neutral bathrooms to accommodate those who require them—without wholesale eliminating single-sex spaces for everyone else."
ad121fd0-5529-46ea-afa6-13b357de8de7,We should abolish no-knock warrants,gpt-4.1,"Honorable judges, esteemed opponents, and valued audience,

Today, we stand before you to argue that no-knock warrants should be abolished—a position grounded in the preservation of civil liberties, the reduction of unnecessary violence, and the promotion of a justice system that honors both security and constitutional rights.

To begin with, let us clarify what no-knock warrants entail. A no-knock warrant is a legal order that allows law enforcement officers to enter a property without prior notification to its occupants—without the customary announcement of “police, open up!” The original intent behind such warrants was to prevent the destruction of evidence, ensure officer safety during high-risk situations, and apprehend dangerous suspects who might otherwise flee or retaliate.

However, in practice, no-knock warrants have proven to be excessively risky, deeply flawed, and fundamentally incompatible with the foundational rights enshrined in our Constitution.

First and foremost, no-knock warrants endanger innocent lives. The principle of “innocent until proven guilty” is not merely a slogan but the cornerstone of our justice system. When police officers burst unannounced into homes—often in the dead of night—mistakes are tragically common. People have been killed or gravely wounded due to misunderstandings, sometimes for the “crime” of trying to defend themselves against what they perceive as home invaders. In the landmark case of Breonna Taylor, an innocent woman lost her life during a botched no-knock raid. Her story is not an isolated incident, but part of a disturbing pattern. Countless families have been traumatized, children terrified, and lives forever altered by raids that targeted the wrong address or relied on faulty information.

Second, the use of no-knock warrants fundamentally violates the Fourth Amendment, which guarantees citizens the right to be secure in their persons, houses, papers, and effects against unreasonable searches and seizures. The necessity of officers announcing themselves before entering is so valued that it has long been recognized by the Supreme Court as a critical barrier against government overreach. Abandoning this principle in favor of expedience undermines the public’s trust in law enforcement and the rule of law itself.

Third, empirical studies have shown that no-knock raids are often disproportionally used in low-level drug offenses, not just the most dangerous or violent crimes. According to data compiled by the American Civil Liberties Union, the vast majority of SWAT deployments are for drug searches rather than high-risk interventions. This broad application turns neighborhoods into warzones, fosters deep fear within the community, and frequently escalates situations that could otherwise be handled peacefully.

The supposed benefits of no-knock warrants—preventing the destruction of evidence or ensuring officer safety—are, upon close analysis, both overstated and insufficient to justify the risks. Alternative policing methods can achieve the same objectives without forfeiting public trust or safety. Announced entries, close surveillance, improved intelligence-gathering, and tactical patience have all proven effective in deterring suspects from disposing of evidence or mounting armed resistance, without the violent chaos of a home invasion.

Moreover, abolishing no-knock warrants would not render law enforcement powerless. In situations of clear and imminent danger, or when there is real, substantiated risk to officer safety, courts already recognize exceptions that allow for dynamic entry when truly necessary. Abolition would simply restore the default expectation that citizens are entitled to know when and why their homes are being invaded—an expectation that upholds due process and fosters transparency.

In conclusion, the time has come to abolish no-knock warrants. Their continued use undermines public safety, disregards constitutional protections, escalates violence, and breeds mistrust between law enforcement and the communities they serve."
b90e031c-8fe6-4224-808d-2ad4e58014a6,We should abolish no-knock warrants,gpt-4.1,"Ladies and gentlemen, esteemed judges, and fellow debaters,

Today, we stand to affirm the motion: ""We should abolish no-knock warrants."" That is, we support the outright elimination of this controversial police practice. Let us be clear: a no-knock warrant allows law enforcement officers to enter a person's residence without announcing their presence or intent, often by force. While intended as a tool for law enforcement in exigent circumstances, no-knock warrants have repeatedly endangered innocent lives, undermined the sanctity of the home, and corroded public trust in the very system meant to protect us. It is time we end them.

Let me outline three fundamental reasons why no-knock warrants must be abolished: first, they pose unacceptable risks to life and safety; second, they erode the foundational rights and liberties enshrined in our Constitution; and third, they fail to achieve their purported law enforcement objectives, often causing more harm than good.

First and foremost, no-knock warrants create a perilous environment where tragedy is not just possible, but frighteningly common. Law enforcement officers, bursting through private doors in the dead of night, encounter startled occupants who may reasonably mistake them for intruders. The consequences are devastating: innocent people, including children and bystanders, have been injured or killed in these chaotic raids. Consider the heartbreaking case of Breonna Taylor in Kentucky, a young woman shot and killed during a botched no-knock raid in 2020. Or the countless families who have woken to violence, confusion, and irreversible loss. These cases are not isolated—according to research by the New York Times and the Washington Post, hundreds of civilians and officers have been harmed or killed as a result of such raids in the past decades. Law enforcement is dangerous work; yet, the tools we give our officers should not create greater tragedies than they purport to avert.

Second, we must remember the foundational principle in our system of government: individual rights and the sanctity of the home. The Fourth Amendment to the United States Constitution guarantees people the right ""to be secure in their persons, houses, papers, and effects, against unreasonable searches and seizures."" The knock-and-announce principle is not recent; it is rooted in centuries-old common law, designed to protect civilians from government abuse and ensure transparency during searches. No-knock warrants, by design, bypass these protections, creating a shadow of unaccountable police action. When law enforcement is empowered to enter any home without warning, under the often-questionable suspicion of danger or evidence destruction, we set dangerous precedents that undermine the very liberties this nation was founded upon. Protecting civil liberties means ensuring that policing is transparent, accountable, and minimally invasive.

Third, no-knock warrants have not been demonstrated to provide effective law enforcement benefits that outweigh their costs. The original rationale was to prevent suspects from destroying evidence or to catch dangerous criminals off guard. Yet, empirically, the supposed benefits are either unproven or vastly overstated. Many targeted substances are not easily destroyed in the moments it takes to knock or announce. And the element of surprise does not always decrease danger; in fact, the confusion it creates has repeatedly led to confrontations that escalate rather than subdue violence. Furthermore, such warrants have been disproportionately executed in minority communities, exacerbating social tensions and reinforcing patterns of discrimination and mistrust.

Opponents may argue that no-knock warrants are issued only in rare, high-risk cases. But the reality is, their use has dramatically expanded over the years, now numbering in the tens of thousands annually in the United States alone."
7769ad2b-537f-43d0-ac5c-01304c8ef6c6,We should subsidize Wikipedia,gpt-4.1,"Honorable judges, esteemed opponents, and valued audience,

Today, we stand in support of a proposition both timely and urgent: that we, as societies invested in knowledge, progress, and equity, should subsidize Wikipedia.

Let’s begin by confronting a simple yet profound reality. In a world awash with misinformation, paywalls, and the commodification of truth, Wikipedia remains an extraordinary outlier—a vast, free, and accessible repository of human knowledge. Whether you’re a student brushing up for an exam, a professional fact-checking a detail, or a curious citizen eager to learn, Wikipedia is often your starting point. Far from being a luxury, it has become a backbone of the global information ecosystem, serving billions of users each month in over 300 languages.

But let me ask: who pays to keep this engine of knowledge running? The answer is instructive. Wikipedia is owned and operated by the non-profit Wikimedia Foundation. It relies almost entirely on voluntary donations from its users, with only a tiny fraction—less than 2%—of those users ever contributing. It neither bombards us with advertising nor sells our personal data. And yet, Wikipedia faces perennial budgetary pressures, threats to its independence, and ever-increasing demands to maintain the quality, reliability, and accessibility the world has come to expect.

The case for subsidy is not about coddling an inefficient entity. It’s about supporting a global public good—an indispensable resource that delivers extraordinary benefits at a minuscule societal cost.

Let us briefly examine those benefits:

First, Wikipedia democratizes knowledge. It is free to all, regardless of nationality, wealth, or social position. This is especially vital in parts of the world where educational resources are scarce, restricted, or heavily filtered. While private publishers and media outlets erect paywalls, Wikipedia tears them down, offering the same information to a student in Silicon Valley as to a villager in rural India.

Second, Wikipedia fosters digital and civic literacy. At a time when information silos, disinformation campaigns, and ideological echo chambers seem ever more pervasive, Wikipedia stands for transparency and verifiability. Its articles are grounded in citations, its edit history open to scrutiny, and its governance, though imperfect, is collaborative and accountable.

Third, Wikipedia catalyzes innovation and research. Countless applications, from Google’s knowledge panels to AI training datasets, rely on Wikipedia as a foundational data source. Academic researchers, journalists, and policymakers reference it daily. These are network effects that amplify Wikipedia’s value far beyond its website.

Now, you may hear arguments today to the effect that public funding threatens Wikipedia’s independence or that subsidies stifle volunteerism. But let’s be clear: a well-designed, arms-length subsidy—allocated transparently and shielded from political interference—can strengthen, not weaken, Wikipedia’s independence. The BBC, public libraries, and national museums all receive public support without becoming mere mouthpieces for governments. Moreover, a robust funding model would allow the Wikimedia Foundation to invest in underrepresented languages, fight vandalism and misinformation, and train new editors—tasks vital for its continued relevance.

Some may say, “If it ain’t broke, don’t fix it.” But this ignores the growing precariousness of Wikipedia’s funding model. As digital competition intensifies and donor fatigue grows, the risk that Wikipedia might one day falter is real. Can we, in conscience, allow such a pillar of our knowledge infrastructure to depend on annual fundraising banners?

In a world where billions are spent propping up industries with far less social value, subsidizing Wikipedia is not only prudent; it is imperative. By providing stable public support, we invest in an open, fact-based society."
50b90983-5392-44f6-889f-0d5ccc1cee83,We should subsidize Wikipedia,gpt-4.1,"Honorable judges, respected opponents, and esteemed audience,

Today, I stand before you to advocate for an idea whose time has truly come: governments and institutions around the world should subsidize Wikipedia.

Let us begin by recognizing what Wikipedia is. Wikipedia is not just another website. It is the world’s single largest free, multilingual, collaboratively edited encyclopedia. It is the beating heart of the open knowledge movement—a living monument to our shared pursuit of learning and truth. With over 6 million articles in English alone and versions in over 300 languages, Wikipedia serves as the first port of call for millions seeking information, be it a student doing homework, a journalist verifying facts, or a curious citizen seeking to understand the world.

So why should we, as societies, invest in Wikipedia?

First, let us consider access—Wikipedia is an unparalleled democratizer of knowledge. Unlike textbooks behind paywalls or academic articles locked away in journals, Wikipedia is free for all, rich or poor, young or old, urban or rural. It removes the barriers to information that perpetuate inequality and exclusion. By subsidizing Wikipedia, we aren’t just supporting a website; we are upholding the principle that everyone deserves access to the sum of human knowledge, regardless of their circumstances.

Second, Wikipedia is a public good in the purest sense. It is non-commercial, non-profit, and run by a global network of volunteers. Its only agenda is the pursuit of accurate, reliable, and unbiased information. It does not bombard us with advertisements, nor does it sell our data. Instead, it relies on small donations from everyday users—a funding model that, while noble, is neither stable nor fair. Year after year, Wikipedia must reach out, hat in hand, begging for donations to keep its servers running and to support the infrastructure that underpins factual information online. Would we ask any other public service to survive on the goodwill of sporadic donors? We subsidize libraries, public broadcasting, and education—because we recognize their value to society. Wikipedia deserves the same treatment.

Third, investing in Wikipedia is an investment in informed citizenship and the health of our democracies. We live in an age plagued by misinformation, disinformation, and conspiracy theories. Social media platforms amplify falsehoods, while search engines often prioritize clicks over credibility. In this chaotic landscape, Wikipedia stands out as a counterweight—a space where facts are sourced, claims are checked, and bias is constantly debated and minimized. To neglect Wikipedia is to starve one of the few trustworthy sources at a time when our societies need truth more than ever.

Fourth, the value provided by Wikipedia far exceeds the modest funding it requires. By some estimates, Wikipedia supports over 15 billion page views each month—an achievement that would cost governments vast sums to replicate through traditional means. Compared to the millions, even billions, spent on public media or educational initiatives, supporting Wikipedia requires a fraction of those resources for exponentially greater reach and impact.

Some may argue that subsidizing Wikipedia would threaten its independence. But let us address this head-on: subsidies can—and should—come without editorial strings attached, just as public libraries and broadcasters maintain strict independence through legislative safeguards. With proper frameworks, Wikipedia can receive public funds while remaining true to its mission and editorial processes. In fact, stable funding will free it from the undue influence of wealthy private donors or corporations.

In conclusion, to subsidize Wikipedia is not merely to support a website. It is to uphold the public good. It is to defend truth against the tides of disinformation."
3d4cc1e3-fa7f-45a6-8570-5b5c7848f27c,We should subsidize investigative journalism,gpt-4.1,"Honorable judges, esteemed opponents, and respected audience,

Today, I stand before you to argue in firm support of the motion: ""We should subsidize investigative journalism."" In an age where information swirls in a maelstrom of noise and distraction, the necessity of robust, independent investigative journalism has never been clearer, nor has it been more threatened. Our shared democratic values, our capacity to identify and address injustice, and our very understanding of the truth depend upon shrewd, relentless reporting that exposes wrongdoing and holds the powerful to account.

First, let us examine the vital role investigative journalism plays in the fabric of our society. Investigative journalism is unlike other forms of reporting; it is painstaking, risky, and often costly. This genre of journalism delves beneath the surface, unearthing corruption, environmental harm, abuse of power, and systemic injustice. From Watergate to the Panama Papers to systemic abuses in countless industries, history is replete with examples where investigative journalism has been the catalyst for sweeping reforms, criminal prosecutions, and public awareness. Simply put, investigative journalism safeguards democracy, empowers the voiceless, and compels transparency from those who would rather operate in the shadows.

Yet, paradoxically, even as the need for such reporting has soared, its foundations have eroded. The traditional business models that once supported investigative journalism are collapsing. Digital advertising revenue is siphoned off by tech giants. Newspaper subscriptions are in decline. Investigative stories, with their long timelines and high costs, are frequently the first casualty in cost-cutting newsrooms. Today, whole regions and critical sectors go unreported; we encounter ""news deserts"" where no thorough scrutiny exists for public officials or institutions. These gaps are not just a media issue—they threaten the health of our democracy.

Let us be clear: Investigative journalism is a public good. It benefits everyone, yet most individuals are not willing or able to pay for it directly. This is the definition of market failure—the kind that justifies public intervention. When the market cannot support a good we all need, it is the government's responsibility to step in and ensure its provision. Subsidizing investigative journalism means providing targeted support to sustain this essential watchdog function, thus restoring balance where the market has failed.

Critics may claim state support equals state control, risking journalistic independence. However, we already know how to set up robust frameworks to preserve editorial independence—look to the models of public broadcasters such as the BBC, NPR, or Scandinavian media. Subsidies can be designed transparently, insulated from government and commercial pressures and allocated based on objective criteria such as public interest, investigative rigor, and reach. Instead of compromising independence, public funding can embolden journalists to pursue the toughest stories without fear of reprisal or commercial imperatives.

Subsidizing investigative journalism is not just a matter of principle—it is a matter of measurable public good. Empirical research demonstrates communities with stronger local journalism enjoy less corruption, improved public health outcomes, and higher civic engagement. Investigations lead to better policy, more effective use of public resources, and genuine social progress. Without investment in this critical function, we risk sliding into a world where only the rich and powerful possess meaningful information—a society vulnerable to manipulation, exploitation, and abuses of power.

In summary, we should subsidize investigative journalism because it is the backbone of democracy, a proven agent of societal progress, and a good the market alone cannot sustain. Thoughtfully structured subsidies will ensure this essential service survives and thrives, enabling journalists to serve the public interest with independence, vigor, and unyielding commitment to the truth."
bda6f4a6-8507-44eb-a789-a08d6627ec47,We should subsidize investigative journalism,gpt-4.1,"Honorable judges, esteemed opponents, and distinguished audience,

Today, I stand before you to affirm the motion: ""We should subsidize investigative journalism."" In an era overwhelmed by misinformation, political polarization, and unchecked institutional power, investigative journalism stands as one of our last, best defenses for truth, accountability, and democracy itself. Yet, it is a form of journalism in crisis—financially constrained and under increasing threat. Subsidizing investigative journalism, therefore, is not merely an economic choice; it is a moral and democratic imperative.

Let us begin by clarifying what investigative journalism is and why it matters. Investigative journalism is the meticulous, time-intensive pursuit of stories that unearth corruption, injustice, and abuses of power. It is not sensationalist headlines or entertainment; it is the dogged pursuit of facts, often when those in power would prefer silence. From exposing the Watergate scandal, bringing down corrupt politicians, unraveling corporate malfeasance, to spotlighting human rights abuses—the greatest safeguard investigative journalism offers is that it makes power answerable to the public. 

However, investigative journalism is expensive, risky, and yields little financial return compared to other forms of media. In recent years, as traditional newsrooms shrink and ad revenues plummet, investigative units are often the first to be cut. According to the Center for Investigative Reporting, the number of reporters assigned to investigative teams in the U.S. has dropped by more than half in the last decade alone. Around the world, investigative journalists face increasing physical risks, legal harassment, and censorship. If the market cannot sustain this public good on its own, society must step in.

Subsidizing investigative journalism addresses these challenges by focusing on three core principles.

First, investigative journalism is a public good. Like clean air, public parks, or national defense, its benefits extend far beyond the individual consumer. An exposé on corporate pollution can benefit every citizen, not just those who read a particular newspaper. Yet, as with other public goods, the market will underprovide what society truly needs. State subsidies correct this fundamental market failure.

Second, subsidizing investigative journalism upholds democracy and informed citizenship. Democracy does not function in a vacuum; it requires a well-informed electorate. When investigative journalism exposes government corruption or systemic injustice, it arms citizens with the information they need to vote intelligently, protest effectively, and participate meaningfully in public life. This has real-world impacts. To cite just one example, the ""Panama Papers"" investigation, funded by nonprofit organizations, resulted in worldwide tax reforms, resignations of corrupt officials, and recovery of billions in lost revenue. None of this would have happened through market-driven journalism alone.

Third, subsidies need not—and must not—compromise journalistic independence. Around the world, models exist where public funding is delivered without state interference: through independent foundations, press councils, or arms-length grant committees. Countries including Norway, Sweden, and the UK administer media subsidies which support diversity and investigative reporting, guard rails for democratic accountability. The key is transparency, merit-based funding, and strict separation from political influence.

Let us also anticipate the main counterarguments. Many worry that subsidies create government dependency or stifle free expression. But with proper oversight and an independent mechanism, we can strike a balance. In fact, we already subsidize other vital public goods—education, libraries, even private businesses—without fundamentally threatening their independence.

In conclusion, failing to subsidize investigative journalism is an invitation for unchecked power, secrecy, and the erosion of democracy. Subsidizing this vital social function is not about rescuing an obsolete business model—it is about defending truth, democracy, and the public’s right to know."
8a035594-a1ab-480b-9170-1fd3bde47141,We should introduce goal line technology,gpt-4.1,"Ladies and gentlemen, esteemed judges, worthy opponents, and members of the audience,

Today we stand at the threshold of progress, where tradition meets innovation, and where the integrity of sport must be safeguarded by the tools of our era. The topic before us is one that speaks not only to the heart of football—the world’s game—but also to the spirit of fair competition across all goal-centric sports. Resolved: We should introduce goal line technology.

At its core, this debate is about justice and accuracy. About giving every team, every player, and every fan the confidence that what happens on the field is decided not by human error, but by athletic prowess. Let me outline the case for why introducing goal line technology is not only beneficial, but essential.

First and foremost, goal line technology (GLT) addresses perhaps the most crucial question in football and similar sports: “Did the ball cross the line?” Human judgment, even at its best, is fallible. Referees’ sightlines are often obstructed, and the speed of modern play makes instant, unerring decisions nearly impossible. This has, time and again, led to heartbreak—goals awarded that never were; goals denied that should have counted. The infamous “ghost goal” during the 2010 FIFA World Cup or England’s disputed goal in 1966 are only a few examples etched permanently into the annals of controversy.

GLT, as proven by its careful adoption in top leagues and tournaments, brings certainty to this most pivotal decision. The technology is impartial, instant, and unobtrusive. Using systems such as Hawk-Eye, multiple high-speed cameras track the ball’s movement to the millimeter. Within a second, a simple message is sent to the referee’s watch: “Goal” or “No goal.” There is no protracted interruption, no subjective debate—just clarity.

Critics may argue that technology erodes the ‘human element’ of sport, but what is the value of sport without fairness? Do we champion tradition when it perpetuates injustice? Football’s enduring spirit lies not solely in its unpredictability, but in its guarantee of equal opportunity. GLT does not disrupt the flow or rhythm of the game; it merely ensures that the decisive moment—the scoring of a goal—is accurately adjudicated.

Secondly, the implementation of GLT strengthens the credibility of competition. In an era when vast fortunes ride on the outcome of matches, and when careers, legacies, and reputations are staked on a single result, can we rely on guesswork? The cost of a single erroneous call can mean the difference between championship glory and devastation. By eliminating these “phantom goals” and “missed goals,” we restore faith in the outcome, ensuring that victory is given only to the truly deserving.

Furthermore, goal line technology serves not just elite competitions. As the technology matures, costs decrease, making wider deployment feasible. Already, the psychological impact is clear: knowing that GLT is present deters dissent, reduces player pressure on referees, and leads to a more respectful, orderly contest.

Let us also remember that the beautiful game is global—watched and loved by billions. In an interconnected world, every controversial moment is replayed, dissected, and debated on screens everywhere. Do we want generations of fans to view historic matches through the lens of what might have been, or what should have been? Or shall we give them the assurance that when the whistle blows, the decision made is right?

To conclude, goal line technology is not a threat to the integrity of sport—it is, in fact, its protector."
8e113476-a5b1-4eb3-be0c-eb30e5114759,We should introduce goal line technology,gpt-4.1,"Ladies and gentlemen, esteemed judges, and honourable opponents,

Today, I stand before you to advocate for the introduction of goal line technology—a transformative tool crucial to safeguarding the integrity, fairness, and excitement of the world’s most beloved sport: football.

Let us begin by recalling what is at stake. Football is not merely a game; it is a unifying force across continents, sparking passion in hearts from Rio de Janeiro to London, from Lagos to Tokyo. Millions of livelihoods—players, coaches, club staff, and fans—are directly entwined with the outcomes of these matches. It is no exaggeration to state that a single goal can change lives, shape legacies, and alter the course of history.

Yet, the simplicity and universality of football’s ultimate question—did the ball cross the line?—has, time and again, been clouded by human error. The referee, unaided and often unsighted, is asked to decide in a split second amid roars of the crowd and the chaos of the penalty box. At times, this has led to egregious miscarriages of justice.

Consider, for example, the infamous incident at the 2010 FIFA World Cup: England’s Frank Lampard unleashed a thunderous shot that clearly struck the crossbar and bounced over the Germany goal line. Yet, lacking technological assistance, the officials missed what millions saw: a legitimate goal. England was denied, and a sporting injustice was written into the history books. This is not an isolated case—it is one of many, in World Cups, Champions League finals, and domestic leagues worldwide.

Goal line technology promises to correct this structural flaw. With high-speed cameras and sophisticated sensors, the system provides instantaneous, definitive proof of whether the ball has wholly crossed the line. No guesswork. No controversy. Just the unassailable truth delivered directly to the referee’s watch—empowering them while upholding the foundational value of fair play.

Some may argue that errors are part of football’s charm or that technology undermines the human element. Yet, we do not nostalgically wish for inaccuracies; we celebrate brilliant goals and dramatic moments, not blunders that rob teams and fans of the joy they truly earned. If we accept technology to judge offside positions, track player performance, or even water pitches, why should we baulk at using it where it matters most—the scoring of goals?

Moreover, goal line technology does not erode the flow or spirit of the game. On the contrary, its efficiency ensures decisions are made instantly, keeping the tempo intact and allowing emotions—whether jubilation or heartache—to be founded on certainty rather than confusion. Compare this with the endless post-match debates, fan animosity, and sometimes even violence provoked by perceived injustices. The introduction of this technology resolves disputes before they ever arise.

Let us also consider its universal fairness. Unlike other forms of video review, which may be subject to interpretation, goal line technology is binary: the ball is either in, or it is out. This objectivity removes bias, favouritism, and pressure from both referees and administrators. Trust in the system grows, transparency prevails, and the beautiful game becomes that much more beautiful.

In conclusion, refusing to adopt goal line technology is a stubborn clinging to an imperfect past at the expense of players, fans, and the very values we hold dear in sports. To ensure that the rightful winners are rewarded, that careers and seasons are not decided by error or accident, and that football can continue to inspire—not frustrate—generations to come, we must embrace the reliability and fairness this technology offers.

Ladies and gentlemen, the time is ripe to introduce goal line technology."
a5f99100-b9b7-4146-8d20-9c842ad53070,We should abolish the American Jobs Act,gpt-4.1,"Distinguished judges, honorable opponents, and esteemed audience:

Today, we stand in firm affirmation of the motion: We should abolish the American Jobs Act.

At first glance, legislation that aims to create jobs, reduce unemployment, and strengthen our workforce seems inherently noble. However, upon closer examination, the American Jobs Act is fundamentally flawed, both in its conception and in its execution. Its continued existence not only perpetuates inefficiency but also stifles innovation, burdens future generations, and distracts from more sustainable, market-based solutions. For these reasons, we firmly advocate for its complete abolition.

Let us begin with the first—and most crucial—point: The American Jobs Act is government overreach masquerading as economic salvation. By funneling massive taxpayer funds into temporary public works, wage subsidies, and targeted tax breaks, the Act distorts the natural flow of the economy. It picks winners and losers, artificially propping up sectors selected not for true merit, but for political appeal. This misallocation of resources prevents the economy from adapting organically to changing times and market signals. While the Act might provide short-term boosts, it does so at the expense of long-term competitiveness and resilience.

Second, the Act’s efficacy in truly creating jobs has been questionable, at best. Extensive analysis shows that the majority of jobs “created or saved” by the American Jobs Act are temporary, vanishing as soon as federal funding dries up. Example after example demonstrates that shovel-ready projects often stall in bureaucratic red tape, or result in jobs that evaporate when the project ends. True, sustainable employment stems from private sector growth driven by demand, entrepreneurship, and innovation—not by government decree or subsidy. The Act’s track record is clear: it may inflate statistics in the short term, but it does nothing to build permanent, self-sustaining employment opportunities.

Third, the ballooning cost of the American Jobs Act cannot be ignored. In a time of mounting national debt and fiscal uncertainty, pouring hundreds of billions into a program with mediocre results is fiscally irresponsible. Every dollar spent is borrowed from future generations; every temporary job comes at a long-term cost. According to nonpartisan economists, the multiplier effect of such direct stimulus spending is far less than promised, particularly as we enter an era of higher interest rates and shrinking economic bandwidth. If we truly care about economic vitality, we must be honest about these costs—and demand efficiency, not waste.

Fourth, heavy regulation and government intervention inherent in the Act often impede the private sector, drowning businesses—especially small and medium-sized enterprises—in compliance paperwork and complex eligibility requirements. Instead of empowering entrepreneurs and local job creators, we inadvertently empower bureaucrats and special interests. The innovation and dynamism that have always been America’s greatest economic engines are weakened, not strengthened, under this system.

Fifth, by maintaining the American Jobs Act, we send the wrong message: that the government—not the people—is the primary driver of prosperity. Rather than encouraging self-reliance, ingenuity, and competition, we foster a culture of dependency. America has historically thrived when government empowers the market, not when it seeks to replace it.

Finally, there are better alternatives. Instead of outdated, top-down stimulus, we should focus on pro-growth tax reform, reducing regulatory barriers, and investing in twenty-first century education and training that prepare our workforce for tomorrow’s jobs—not yesterday’s. By abolishing the American Jobs Act, we free up resources and innovation for solutions that actually address the root causes of unemployment and economic stagnation."
680a84ea-8daa-40f3-b8b8-b253543b6c71,We should abolish the American Jobs Act,gpt-4.1,"Honorable judges, esteemed opponents, ladies and gentlemen,

Today, I stand before you to argue in favor of a stance both crucial and contentious: that we should, indeed, abolish the American Jobs Act. I understand this is a bold assertion, given the Act’s branding as a lifeline for U.S. employment and its perceived intent to strengthen our economy. Yet, as responsible citizens and critical thinkers, we must look beyond rhetoric and scrutinize the efficacy, impact, and unintended consequences of such sweeping federal legislation. It is in this scrutiny that the case for abolishing the American Jobs Act emerges not just as reasonable, but as necessary.

Let us first examine the core promises of the Act. Proponents argue it creates jobs through government spending on infrastructure, tax credits, and assistance to the unemployed. While these measures sound laudable at first glance, a deeper dive reveals glaring shortcomings. The Act’s central premise—that top-down, federal intervention drives sustainable job growth—has proven, time and again, to be fundamentally flawed. Historical precedent teaches us that government-driven job creation is often inefficient, wasteful, and temporary compared to that generated organically by the private sector.

Consider the data. The immediate aftermath of the Act saw outlays in the billions, yet labor force participation rates stagnated, real wage growth stalled, and many of the so-called “jobs saved or created” were, in fact, temporary government or subsidized positions. Rather than empowering businesses to innovate and expand, the Act diverted capital and resources from the productive private sector to the less efficient public sphere. A 2015 Congressional Budget Office analysis found that similar stimulus measures produced only modest, short-term gains at the monumental cost of deepening national debt. Simply put, for every dollar spent, the returns—in terms of permanent jobs and economic vitality—were lackluster.

Secondly, the Act’s tax credits and incentives sound helpful, but in reality, they often distort the labor market. By favoring select industries or employers who comply with federal mandates, the Act creates winners and losers, picking favorites rather than allowing the free market to allocate resources efficiently. This fosters cronyism, stifles innovation, and punishes small businesses unable to navigate complex federal requirements. The result? A playing field increasingly uneven, stifling the very entrepreneurship and dynamism the American economy thrives upon.

Equally concerning are the Act’s long-term fiscal implications. With the U.S. debt surpassing $33 trillion, the continued funding of such expansive programs places an unconscionable burden on future generations. Every dollar appropriated in the name of “jobs” today is a dollar borrowed from our children tomorrow. And fiscal responsibility is not mere rhetoric—it is an economic imperative. Deficits drive inflation, erode confidence in our currency, and restrict the government’s ability to respond to future crises. Instead of sustainable job growth, the Act risks saddling us with financial instability.

Moreover, the very existence of the American Jobs Act perpetuates a dangerous precedent: that whenever the economy faces headwinds, the answer must be another round of sweeping federal intervention. This dependency undermines both state sovereignty and local problem-solving, centralizing authority in Washington at the expense of diverse, community-driven solutions. Each region of our vast nation faces unique economic challenges—and it is local actors, not distant bureaucrats, who are best positioned to craft effective strategies.

In conclusion, the intentions behind the American Jobs Act may well have been noble—but as we have seen, noble intentions are no substitute for real results. The Act is emblematic of a failed philosophy: that jobs can be created by decree, resources allocated by fiat, futures secured by overpromising and overspending."
1643999a-075b-402f-bc63-e1c356b14aaf,We should abandon social media,gpt-4.1,"Ladies and gentlemen, esteemed judges, respected opponents, and honored audience members,

Today, I rise in strong affirmation of the motion: We should abandon social media.

When the first social media platforms emerged, they promised to connect us — to bridge distances, spark creativity, and foster global communities. Yet, as decades have passed, the scales have tipped, and the adverse effects now far outweigh whatever benefits these platforms once conferred. To truly advance as individuals and as a society, it is imperative that we abandon social media.

Let us begin with one of the most pressing concerns: the assault on mental health. Studies by institutions such as the Royal Society for Public Health have found direct correlations between time spent on social media and upticks in depression, anxiety, loneliness, and poor self-image, particularly among the youth. Social media platforms are meticulously engineered to capture attention, exploiting psychological vulnerabilities to foster addictive usage. The perpetual scroll, the dopamine rush of notifications, and the pressure for validation through likes or shares have thrust us into a never-ending contest of comparison — eroding self-esteem and fueling a crisis of identity.

Beyond individual harm, social media is a breeding ground for misinformation and polarization. Algorithms prioritize content that elicits strong emotional responses — outrage, indignation, fear — to keep users engaged. These echo chambers fracture our societies, amplify extremism, and accelerate the spread of fake news. In crucial elections around the globe, social media has been weaponized to sow distrust and manipulate outcomes, undermining the very foundation of democracy. The consequences are not hypothetical; we live in the shadow of their reality.

Moreover, the erosion of privacy is a profound concern. Where once personal boundaries were sacrosanct, now our every action, preference, and thought is commodified. User data becomes the raw material harvested with little oversight, sold, traded, and analyzed to predict, persuade, and sometimes manipulate behavior. Even mundane moments are now content fodder for public consumption. This is not connection — this is surveillance.

Consider also the toll on genuine human interaction. Social media was meant to bring us closer, yet studies show that it often leaves us feeling more isolated. Online interactions are shallow, curated, and transactional. Physical conversations are interrupted by digital distractions, weakening the fabric of real relationships. The time we spend crafting digital personas is time not spent nurturing authentic bonds. As research confirms, the more we substitute online communication for face-to-face exchange, the lonelier we become.

We must also reckon with the devastating impact on public discourse and civic engagement. Civil disagreements degrade into anonymous attacks. Nuance is lost in the deluge of rapid-fire commentary. A complex issue is reduced to a trending hashtag, depriving us of the thoughtful deliberation that societal progress requires. If our discourse is confined to sound bites and outrage, how can we hope to solve the challenges we face?

Lastly, social media has fostered a culture of consumption and distraction. From doomscrolling to viral challenges, our attention is constantly diverted from purposeful activity and deep focus. Productivity, creativity, and our very capacity to be present are casualties in the battle for our attention.

Ladies and gentlemen, the cumulative impact is clear: Mental health crises, fractured communities, eroded privacy, weakened relationships, degraded civic culture, and diminished wellbeing. Social media may have offered a seductive promise, but the lived experience is one of exploitation and harm.

Therefore, I urge this house: Let us abandon social media. It is time to reclaim our mental health, rejuvenate our communities, protect our privacy, restore authentic human connections, and build a society rooted in trust, empathy, and substance."
74ac4fae-ac28-41d1-900f-56694ac758b9,We should abandon social media,gpt-4.1,"Ladies and gentlemen, honorable judges, esteemed opponents, and all those gathered here today, thank you for the opportunity to address this pressing issue: “We should abandon social media.”

Our world has been transformed by technology in countless positive ways. Yet, with social media, we stand at a crossroads—a technological marvel that has subtly yet profoundly shaped our society, not always for the better. Today, I stand before you not to argue against technology itself, but to assert, with evidence and urgency, that we should abandon social media. Let me set out the compelling reasons why.

Firstly, social media is a primary driver of widespread mental health crises. A mountain of peer-reviewed studies has emerged in recent years showing alarming associations between social media use and heightened rates of anxiety, depression, loneliness, and even suicide—particularly among young people. The curated perfection, endless comparison, and constant validation-seeking fostered on these platforms undermine self-esteem and fuel insecurity. When teenagers scroll through flawless images and filtered lifestyles, the consequence is not inspiration, but a sense of inadequacy. A 2019 study published in JAMA Psychiatry found a significant link between social media usage and an uptick in depressive symptoms. Are we, as a society, truly willing to accept such harm in exchange for a fleeting connection or a few digital likes?

Second, social media has become one of our greatest threats to democracy and civil discourse. Misinformation spreads faster on Facebook and Twitter than truth ever could. Algorithms, driven by profit, amplify conspiracy theories, fake news, and extremist content because outrage is more “engaging” and profitable than reasoned debate. We have witnessed how entire elections can be manipulated—and trust in institutions eroded—through targeted disinformation campaigns. The January 6th Capitol riot was fueled not by thoughtful debate, but by viral falsehoods rapidly disseminated on social media. Social media’s structure rewards division, not unity. Can we, in good conscience, continue to give these platforms such unchecked power over our societies and our democracies?

Third, social media endangers privacy on a scale never seen before. Our most personal data—habits, beliefs, location, even our biometrics—are harvested, analyzed, bought, and sold. Platforms that are “free” extract payment in the currency of our lives. This commodification of privacy has led to the rise of unprecedented surveillance capitalism, data breaches, and rampant identity theft. We don’t need to imagine a dystopia where Big Brother watches our every move—social media has already brought it quietly into being, often with our willing participation. 

Fourth, let us consider social media’s corrosive effect on real human connection and productivity. Instead of cherishing face-to-face conversation, we become absorbed in curated highlight reels. Instead of focused work, our attention splinters into notifications, likes, and retweets. Social media addicts us, stealing hours and sapping our ability to be present in the real world. The constant tug of the digital feed robs us of creativity, attention, and, above all, meaningful relationships.

Proponents will argue that social media connects us, breaks down barriers, and supports activism. There is truth to this—technology can bring us together—but social media, specifically, too often does the opposite: it isolates, polarizes, and manipulates.

Imagine a world where we reclaim our time, our privacy, our mental well-being, and our democracy. Where we nurture connections face-to-face, foster civil discourse through genuine conversation, and access information without manipulation or surveillance.

Abandoning social media does not mean abandoning progress. It means making a conscious, collective choice to create healthier, more sustainable ways to communicate and connect."
be2d729e-cf37-400c-9546-fc1e50ed663b,We should increase fuel tax,gpt-4.1,"Ladies and gentlemen, esteemed judges, and fellow debaters,

Today, I stand in firm affirmation of the motion: ""We should increase fuel tax."" This is not just a matter of fiscal policy; it is a matter of economic prudence, environmental stewardship, and social responsibility. Allow me to lay out the compelling reasons why increasing fuel tax is not only justified, but necessary.

First and foremost, let us consider the environmental imperative. The combustion of fossil fuels is the primary driver of climate change. According to the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, transportation accounts for nearly a quarter of global carbon dioxide emissions. Fuel taxes are a proven and practical tool to address this crisis. By making fossil fuels more expensive, we create a financial incentive for individuals and businesses to reduce consumption, seek alternatives, and invest in cleaner technologies. Countries like Sweden and Norway have shown that sustained, targeted fuel taxes can lead to significant reductions in greenhouse gas emissions while maintaining economic growth.

Secondly, increasing fuel tax directly combats the many hidden costs—what economists call externalities—associated with fossil fuel consumption. Every liter of gasoline burned not only pollutes the air but also inflicts damage on public health through increased rates of asthma, heart disease, and premature death. These are costs society collectively bears—in higher healthcare expenditures, lost productivity, and diminished quality of life. A higher fuel tax internalizes these costs, making polluters pay and shifting the burden away from taxpayers and vulnerable communities.

Third, a higher fuel tax can provide critical funding for infrastructure and public transportation. Throughout the world, roads, bridges, and transit systems are deteriorating due to chronic underfunding. By linking fuel consumption to infrastructure funding, we create a sustainable revenue stream. Take Germany, for example—revenue from fuel taxes is a cornerstone of their robust, high-quality public transit networks. Improved infrastructure not only benefits commuters, but also businesses, emergency services, and the economy as a whole.

Now, some may argue that a fuel tax is regressive and burdens lower-income households. This is a concern we take seriously. However, evidence shows that with thoughtful policy design, these impacts can be mitigated or even reversed. For example, a portion of fuel tax revenue can be redirected as targeted rebates or social benefits for low-income groups. Furthermore, investment in affordable public transportation offers everyone, regardless of income, greater mobility and access to opportunity. The principle is simple: we can, and must, use fuel tax revenue to correct past inequities, not deepen them.

Moreover, increasing fuel tax encourages innovation and economic diversification. When fuel is artificially cheap, there is little incentive to develop or adopt new technologies. By aligning the price at the pump with the true cost to society, we spur investment in electric vehicles, sustainable urban planning, and renewable energy—all sectors poised to create the jobs of the future. Look at how surging oil prices over past decades have unleashed waves of innovation in cleaner, more efficient vehicles. A fuel tax creates a stable, predictable path forward, allowing businesses to adapt and thrive.

Finally, addressing climate change and transitioning to sustainable energy is not a burden: it is an opportunity. Countries that act now—not later—will be the leaders of the 21st century economy. Rising to meet our environmental and fiscal challenges with courage and foresight is not just good policy; it is good leadership.

In summary, increasing the fuel tax is a powerful, evidence-based way to protect our climate, our health, our economy, and our future. It is a policy that, when designed with fairness and ambition, offers extraordinary benefits to both current and coming generations.

Thank you."
945781fa-4cb6-47e9-8375-12618b85da76,We should increase fuel tax,gpt-4.1,"Honourable judges, esteemed opponents, and distinguished audience,

Today, we stand to advocate for an essential and timely proposition: that we should increase fuel tax. In an era defined by warming climates, skyrocketing traffic congestion, and urgent government budgetary needs, increasing the fuel tax is not just an option—it is a necessity.

Let us consider the most pressing reason: climate change. The scientific consensus is irrefutable. Greenhouse gas emissions, predominantly from burning fossil fuels like petrol and diesel, are the leading cause of global warming. The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change warns that, without decisive action, temperatures could rise by more than two degrees Celsius this century—leading to devastating consequences. A higher fuel tax is one of the most direct and effective measures available to curb carbon emissions from the transport sector. By making fossil fuel use more expensive, we create a powerful economic incentive for individuals and businesses to drive less, choose public transit, and invest in cleaner technologies. History shows us this works—countries such as Sweden, the UK, and Germany, which levy higher fuel taxes, have achieved greater reductions in transport emissions compared to countries with lower taxes.

Now, consider the principle of fairness, often referred to as the “polluter pays” principle. Why should society as a whole bear the health and environmental costs of pollution, when it is specific activities—burning fuel—that directly cause the harm? A higher fuel tax ensures that those who generate negative externalities pay proportionately to the harm they cause. This is not about punishment, but about responsibility and fairness. It is about internalizing costs that are otherwise silently borne by everyone—by our children with asthma, by cities lost to rising sea levels, by farmers facing unprecedented droughts.

But let us not limit our argument to the environment. There are powerful economic and social reasons to support an increase in fuel tax. Consider the congestion epidemic that plagues our cities. Traffic jams sap productivity and cost economies billions of dollars each year, while the health toll of air pollution falls heavily on vulnerable populations. By making private vehicle use comparatively more expensive, a fuel tax helps shift behaviour towards carpooling and the use of sustainable urban transport systems. The resulting reduction in congestion not only saves commuters time and money but improves the quality of urban life for all citizens.

Some will argue that increasing fuel taxes is regressive, unfairly burdening poorer households. But this overlooks the opportunity for smart policy design. The revenues generated by fuel taxes can—and should—be redirected towards those most in need. Imagine: every extra dollar collected could be used to reduce income inequality, either by direct cash transfers to low-income families, by investing in fare-free public transit, or by subsidizing energy-efficient vehicles. In British Columbia, Canada, a carbon tax is already paired with rebates for low-income households—a proven system for balancing justice and sustainability.

Let us not forget the fiscal argument. Revenue from increased fuel taxes offers governments the means to invest in vital infrastructure—high-speed trains, safe cycling networks, efficient buses—that accelerate the transition to a cleaner future. Unlike the volatility of oil markets or the unpredictability of corporate tax receipts, fuel taxes provide a steady and predictable source of public funding. This is especially crucial given aging infrastructure and strained public budgets.

In summary, increasing the fuel tax is the rare policy that delivers on all fronts. It defends our planet, upholds fairness, eases congestion, addresses public health, and strengthens our public finances. Far from being an unnecessary sacrifice, it is an investment in a cleaner, healthier, and more equitable society."
cddcc9ce-3993-4d3e-82f9-ff6bb5f8b8c6,We should legalize public nudity,gpt-4.1,"Ladies and gentlemen, esteemed judges, and honorable opponents, today I stand before you to argue in firm support of the motion: “We should legalize public nudity.”

At first, this topic might seem provocative or even uncomfortable. Yet, behind the surface lies a fundamental discussion about human rights, body autonomy, cultural evolution, and the broader benefits to society. I invite you to consider with open minds the compelling reasons why legalizing public nudity is not only reasonable, but necessary for any society that values freedom, equality, and holistic well-being.

First and foremost, let us address the principle of bodily autonomy. In democratic societies, we champion individuals’ rights over their bodies. We reject coercion in matters of dress, appearance, and identity. The prohibition of public nudity is, in essence, a restriction on these freedoms. It assumes that certain bodies must be hidden, policed, or shamed—not because of any inherent harm, but because of inherited taboos or discomfort. Legalizing public nudity affirms each person’s autonomy over their body, sending a powerful message that bodies are not objects of shame or scandal, but natural, diverse, and neutral facets of human existence.

Secondly, the current prohibitions on public nudity are rooted more in cultural bias and historical prudery than in logic or public harm. Around the world, from traditional African societies to Scandinavian saunas, public nudity is normalized and does not result in chaos or moral decline. In fact, restricting nudity often perpetuates unhealthy attitudes towards bodies, reinforcing unrealistic standards and shame—especially amongst girls, women, and marginalized groups. By legalizing public nudity, we begin to dismantle these stigmas, fostering greater acceptance of diversity in all its forms—size, shape, age, ability.

Third, let us consider the benefits to public health, both mental and physical. Studies from clothing-optional communities, nudist beaches, and societies with more relaxed attitudes towards nudity demonstrate higher self-esteem, lower body dissatisfaction, and improved social cohesion. When people see the natural diversity of bodies, unrealistic expectations wither. This, in turn, can reduce mental health issues stemming from body image, eating disorders, and toxic shame. Public nudity also promotes vitamin D absorption, reduces laundry waste, and allows for greater comfort in extreme heat—practical, everyday benefits.

Fourth, from a legal perspective, the criminalization of public nudity is fraught with inconsistencies. What counts as ""indecent"" or ""obscene"" varies widely across jurisdictions and contexts, leading to arbitrary enforcement and, disproportionately, the targeting of minority and vulnerable groups. Legalizing nudity brings clarity, fairness, and respect to our legal system. It also allows law enforcement to focus resources on real crimes—assault, harassment, exploitation—rather than harmless exposure.

One common objection is that public nudity is inherently sexual, and therefore should be restricted. Yet sexuality is a matter of context, not exposure. A naked body, in itself, is no more sexual than a clothed one. By conflating nudity with obscenity, we foster the very confusion and shame that drive problematic behaviors. In fact, when nudity is normalized, the temptation to ogle or harass disappears; a community that has seen every kind of body loses interest in policing or objectifying them.

Let us also remember that many legal norms we now find absurd were once staunchly defended—laws against women’s bathing suits, against interracial marriage, even against dancing in public. Progress comes from questioning inherited taboos and asking: Does this restriction really protect or benefit us? In the case of public nudity, the answer is clear—it does not.

To conclude, legalizing public nudity is about far more than clothing; it is about freedom, acceptance, and the courage to challenge needless conventions."
97c7a442-7cf9-400c-9309-521b6172688d,We should legalize public nudity,gpt-4.1,"Honorable judges, esteemed opponents, and valued members of the audience,

Today, we stand before you to advocate for a topic that challenges social conventions, yet promises to advance fundamental human freedoms and foster a more inclusive, tolerant society. We contend that public nudity should be legalized. Our position is grounded in the principles of individual liberty, body positivity, and social well-being, all of which are stifled by the current criminalization of public nudity.

At the heart of our argument lies the principle of autonomy — the right of each person to make decisions about their own body, provided they harm no one else. The state’s current restrictions on public nudity are not rooted in the prevention of harm, but rather in the policing of societal norms and personal discomforts. In a democratic and free society, the government’s role is to protect us from actual harm, not to enforce arbitrary standards of modesty. Just as we have rejected draconian laws about dress codes in the past — such as those condemning women for wearing pants, or forbidding swimsuits deemed “indecent” — so too should we now question why bare skin itself is a crime.

Second, the legalization of public nudity serves as a powerful tool in promoting body positivity and combating the unrealistic beauty standards perpetuated by modern media. Today’s societies are riddled with body shaming, eating disorders, and deep insecurities, often stemming from the belief that the human body must be hidden, that only “perfect” forms are acceptable to display. By normalizing nudity in public spaces, we challenge these notions at their core. The human body, in all its diversity, becomes ordinary rather than scandalous. Studies from countries and communities where public nudity is more accepted — such as certain beaches in Spain, Germany, and Scandinavia — repeatedly show lower levels of body shame, greater acceptance of diversity, and improved mental health overall. If public nudity were legalized, we could nurture a society that celebrates bodies as they are, not as advertisements tell us they should be.

Some may argue that legalizing public nudity would result in a breakdown of public morality or increased indecency. However, this claim does not withstand scrutiny. First, there is no innate connection between nudity and sexual conduct. Public nudity is not public sex, and conflating the two only reinforces stigma and misunderstanding. Where public nudity is allowed, as in certain city parks or beaches around the world, there is no evidence of increased crime or social chaos. In fact, regulations can — and should — distinguish between non-sexual nudity and inappropriate or criminal behavior, such as harassment or lewd acts, which would remain illegal.

Furthermore, legalizing public nudity would reduce the harassment and criminalization of marginalized groups, such as breastfeeding mothers, trans and non-binary individuals, and those who practice naturism for cultural or philosophical reasons. No one should fear police intervention for simply existing in their natural state. The law as it stands unfairly targets and punishes the vulnerable, perpetuating discrimination under the guise of decency.

By legalizing public nudity, we reaffirm our commitment to pluralism, freedom, and the dignity of all individuals. We empower citizens to accept themselves and each other, to challenge stigma, and to treat bodies as natural — not shameful — realities. In essence, legalizing public nudity is a small but significant step toward a fairer, more open society.

Let us not allow fear or tradition to dictate our laws. Instead, let us embrace progress, reason, and compassion."
9a20ab0d-edc4-46a5-a481-fd9f729e1b42,We should ban anonymous posts,gpt-4.1,"Honorable judges, esteemed opponents, and respected audience,

Today we stand at the crossroads of a fundamental question that shapes the very fabric of our digital society: Should we allow anonymity to shield those who interact online, or is it time to demand accountability from everyone who participates in the public digital square? I stand firmly on the side that says: We should ban anonymous posts.

Let me be clear from the outset—this is not an attack on privacy, or an attempt to chill free speech. Instead, it is a call to restore the values of integrity, accountability, and trust to our online communities—values that anonymity erodes, sometimes irrevocably.

First, anonymity perpetuates toxic behavior. The shroud of invisibility grants individuals the liberty to act without fear of consequences. As study after study has shown, people are far more likely to post hate speech, threats, defamation, and harassment when they know their identities are hidden. Cyberbullying, doxxing, and coordinated harassment campaigns often originate from anonymous sources. The scars left by these attacks are all too real: young people who fall victim to online bullying face increased risks of depression, anxiety, and, tragically, suicide. Is it justifiable to prioritize the remote possibility of necessary anonymity over the very real suffering caused by nameless attackers?

Second, anonymity fundamentally undermines accountability. Democracies and healthy communities thrive when people can trust each other and the information they share. When posts are anonymous, it becomes nearly impossible to hold anyone responsible for falsehoods, misinformation, or malicious activity. Just consider the spread of fake news, health hoaxes, or election interference campaigns—so often conducted by armies of faceless bots and trolls. When nobody is identifiable, nobody is answerable. Banning anonymous posts would not prevent all misinformation, but it would certainly make it riskier and less appealing for bad actors to sow chaos.

Third, anonymity erodes the foundation of trust itself. Imagine walking into a town hall where every participant wears a mask, making it impossible to know who stands among you, or what motivations they carry. Would you feel safe voicing your own opinions? Would you believe what others say? Genuine conversation—a give and take based on respect, mutual knowledge, and social norms—becomes impossible. By contrast, requiring visible identities nurtures civility, cooperation, and honesty.

Some may claim that banning anonymous posts imperils free speech, and that dissenters, whistleblowers, or marginalized groups require anonymity to voice unpopular opinions. But let us draw a sharp distinction between anonymity and confidentiality. There are, and should be, carve-outs for genuine whistleblowers—structures where individuals can bring forth critical information safely and responsibly. But the overwhelming majority of anonymous posts do not serve righteous dissent; they simply shield misconduct, amplify misuse, and foster chaos.

Furthermore, banning anonymous posts enhances the quality of discourse. When individuals stand behind their statements, they are more likely to check their facts, exercise restraint, and engage in meaningful ways. This is the standard to which we hold participants in traditional journalism, in academia, and in our workplaces. Why should the digital public square be exempt from these minimum standards of accountability?

Finally, technology has reached a point where identity verification can protect users from retribution, without sacrificing accountability or safety. Responsible system design can balance the need for user protection with the necessity of identifiable participation.

In sum, to protect our communities from harm, to nurture truth and trust, and to restore integrity to our digital discourse, we must ban anonymous posts. Name and accountability form the very bedrock of a healthy society—online as much as offline."
5d770d9b-00c4-487b-86bc-60ec3cb63967,We should ban anonymous posts,gpt-4.1,"Honorable judges, esteemed opponents, and members of the audience:

Today, we are gathered to debate an issue that strikes at the very heart of our digital society: whether we should ban anonymous posts. I proudly stand in affirmation of this motion, convinced that banning anonymous posts is both a necessary and responsible step toward creating a healthier, safer, and more accountable online environment.

Let me begin by addressing the foundational principles which govern our societies: responsibility and accountability. In the offline world, our words and actions are tied directly to our identities. We intuitively understand that with the right to express ourselves comes a corresponding duty to answer for the consequences of that expression. Yet the internet, through the shield of anonymity, severs this crucial link. When a person is allowed to post anonymously, they are effectively absolved of personal responsibility. Banning anonymous posts would restore this vital ethical connection between speech and speaker, and it would powerfully reinforce the notion that words—whether online or offline—have real-world consequences.

Second, the evidence is overwhelming that anonymity fosters harmful and toxic behaviors online. Research from multiple universities, including Stanford and MIT, demonstrates that users who post under a cloak of anonymity are significantly more likely to engage in hate speech, bullying, harassment, and the spreading of misinformation. The tragic cases of cyberbullying leading to self-harm and even suicide are, sadly, too numerous to recount. Websites and social media networks that allow anonymous posting are consistently plagued by higher incidents of abuse, threats, and the proliferation of illegal content. By banning anonymous posts, we not only deter these behaviors but also empower platforms and law enforcement to hold offenders accountable. This makes our digital spaces safer for everyone—especially the vulnerable.

Third, eliminating anonymous posts enhances both the credibility and the quality of online discourse. Anonymous communication, by its very nature, erodes trust. How can we engage in meaningful debate or rely on information when we have no idea who is speaking or what agendas they may harbor? When people are required to associate their real identities with their words, the incentive to mislead, deceive, or otherwise act maliciously is dramatically reduced. Furthermore, identity-linked posting encourages more thoughtful, respectful, and informed contributions. Our society desperately needs this: the internet is awash in conspiracy theories, manufactured outrage, and misleading claims, much of which is propagated by faceless agents. Banning anonymous posts helps ensure that our digital forums foster constructive conversation, learning, and civic engagement.

Fourth, critics of this proposal often invoke the noble cause of free speech, contending that anonymity is essential for whistleblowers, dissenters, and those living under repressive regimes. While such concerns must be carefully weighed, they do not justify the blanket protection of anonymous posting in all contexts. In democratic societies with robust legal protections, there are established, secure channels for reporting wrongdoing without exposing oneself to undue risk—channels that balance the need for transparency with the imperative of protection. For specific, limited scenarios—such as sensitive journalistic investigations—temporary pseudonymity or protective disclosure mechanisms can be carefully regulated without resorting to unrestricted anonymity. A nuanced approach that addresses legitimate concerns does not require that we tolerate the sweeping harms anonymity inflicts on the broader digital public sphere.

Finally, we must recognize that the call for banning anonymous posts is not about silencing voices; it is about reclaiming the dignity and safety of our shared online spaces. By making users stand behind their words, we promote a culture of civility, truthfulness, and mutual respect. We challenge each other to communicate as responsible citizens, not as invisible strangers."
292410ee-27c8-4b9f-ae26-e5f6ef697c42,Assisted suicide should be a criminal offence,gpt-4.1,"Ladies and gentlemen, esteemed judges, and respected opposition,

Today we debate a matter of profound ethical, legal, and societal consequence: Should assisted suicide be a criminal offence? Standing firmly in proposition, I contend that the criminalisation of assisted suicide is essential to uphold the sanctity of life, protect the vulnerable, and preserve the ethical integrity of our society. 

First and foremost, let us consider the foundational value upon which all civilised societies rest: the sanctity of human life. Our legal systems categorically prohibit homicide in all its forms, regardless of motive, because life is regarded as an inviolable right. To carve out an exception for assisted suicide is to undermine this bedrock principle. If we permit individuals to facilitate the death of another—even with consent—we erode the universal value placed on human life and risk normalising the very notion that some lives are less worth living. The law must send an unequivocal message: human life is not disposable, and neither suffering nor subjective despair can justify its deliberate destruction.

Secondly, we must confront the stark reality of vulnerability. The terminally ill, the elderly, and the disabled often face immense psychological, physical, and social pressures. It is a tragic misconception to assume that consent under such duress is always truly voluntary or autonomous. Direct or indirect coercion—whether stemming from an individual’s own despair, a family’s emotional fatigue, or societal attitudes toward disability and aging—can insidiously influence decisions surrounding assisted suicide. The risk of abuse is real and has been evidenced in jurisdictions where assisted suicide is legal, leading to cases where patients are pressured, explicitly or implicitly, to end their lives for reasons as diverse as financial burden or fear of loneliness. The criminalisation of assisted suicide acts as a critical barrier, signalling that society will not tolerate the exploitation or marginalisation of its most vulnerable members.

Furthermore, legalising assisted suicide is a slippery slope with perilous consequences. Once the door is opened, the criteria for eligibility inevitably expand: what begins as an exception for the terminally ill is soon extended to those with chronic illnesses, mental health issues, or even non-medical suffering. Where do we draw the line? Evidence from countries that have legalised assisted suicide, such as Belgium and the Netherlands, illustrates this incremental broadening, resulting in ethical quandaries and public unease. The only sustainable safeguard is to draw a clear, unyielding boundary—by criminalising assisted suicide unequivocally.

Beyond the individual, we must also weigh the societal impact. Normalising assisted suicide risks sending a damaging message about the dignity and value of those facing difficulty or decline. Instead of affirming their worth and providing them with robust support—such as palliative care, counselling, and social resources—we offer the tragic option of death. This is not compassion; it is abandonment. The law should reflect society’s duty to accompany people through hardship, not expedite their exit from it.

Some may argue that criminalising assisted suicide infringes upon personal autonomy or prolongs unnecessary suffering. However, every society accepts that individual freedoms have limits, especially when acts harm others or corrode values central to the public good. The answer to suffering and despair must be found in expanding support, enhancing care, and addressing underlying social, medical, and psychological needs, not in legalising facilitation of death.

In conclusion, the criminalisation of assisted suicide is not an outdated dogma but a necessary affirmation of life, protection, and societal care. It sets boundaries that safeguard the vulnerable, resists dangerous ethical erosion, and gives hope where there might otherwise be despair."
65fb2eaf-7147-441a-8fab-4f92cb144672,Assisted suicide should be a criminal offence,gpt-4.1,"Honourable judges, esteemed opponents, ladies and gentlemen,

Today, we gather to debate an issue that sits at the intersection of ethics, law, medicine, and the heart of human dignity: whether assisted suicide should be a criminal offence. On behalf of the proposition, I stand before you to assert that assisted suicide must indeed remain a criminal offence in our society. Allow me to present the case for this stance.

Let us first consider the fundamental role of the law in safeguarding life. The bedrock of our legal system, enshrined in constitutions and international human rights charters, is the sanctity and inviolability of human life. The prohibition against intentionally ending another’s life — whether through homicide, euthanasia, or assisted suicide — is not simply an arbitrary rule; it is a reflection of our collective moral conviction that every human life has intrinsic value, regardless of circumstance. To decriminalize assisted suicide would undermine this foundational principle, sending a dangerous message that some lives are less worth living, less worth protecting.

Next, let us examine the matter of vulnerability and the risk of abuse. Those who seek assisted suicide are often among society’s most vulnerable: the elderly, the disabled, the gravely ill, or individuals suffering from mental health crises. In moments of profound physical or emotional pain, people may not be able to exercise fully autonomous, rational judgment. Legalizing assisted suicide, or even failing to criminalize it, creates a slippery slope, where subtle pressures — whether from family, caregivers, or financial constraints — could coerce individuals into ending their lives. Is this not a betrayal of our duty to protect the weakest among us?

History and contemporary global experience show that safeguards intended to protect vulnerable populations are inevitably imperfect. In places where assisted suicide has been legalized, widening criteria and so-called ""mission creep"" are well-documented. Laws initially intended only for the terminally ill have been extended in some jurisdictions to those with chronic illness, psychological suffering, or even changeable depression. The criminal law, by contrast, draws a firm, clear line that upholds life and protects against even the possibility of abuse.

We must also consider the impact on the medical profession and the fabric of trust between doctor and patient. The Hippocratic Oath, the very foundation of medical ethics, enjoins doctors to “do no harm.” If physicians are permitted to hasten death, the relationship is fundamentally altered. Patients may come to fear that, when times are hard, their doctor might suggest or subtly encourage them to consider ending their lives, rather than exhaust all resources to provide care and comfort. The criminalization of assisted suicide preserves the essential trust that patients place in their doctors: that the sole purpose of medical care is to heal, to alleviate suffering, and to support, never to curtail life.

Furthermore, the argument from autonomy, often cited by opponents, does not hold when weighed against the collective interests of society. Laws exist to define what is permissible not only for the sake of individuals, but for the common good. We criminalize theft, even if the victim consents; we criminalize dangerous drugs, even when users beg for access; similarly, we must criminalize assisted suicide, because the harm extends beyond the individuals involved. It erodes reverence for life, destabilizes societal commitments to care for the vulnerable, and potentially unleashes consequences none of us desire.

Ladies and gentlemen, in a society grounded in compassion, the appropriate response to suffering is not to enable death, but to redouble our efforts in palliative care, mental health support, and communal solidarity."
4d6ef59b-0218-4151-86e1-32bdc38c70c3,We should abolish the two-party system,gpt-4.1,"Ladies and gentlemen, esteemed judges, and fellow debaters,

Today, I stand before you to argue that we should abolish the two-party system. This is not a mere call for political redecoration; it is a demand for substantive change—change that is urgently needed to restore the health, vibrancy, and fairness of our democracy.

The two-party system, as it currently exists, is fundamentally flawed. It does not represent the diverse views of the people. Instead, it entrenches division, stifles innovation, and encourages a toxic political climate. I invite you to consider three central contentions: the two-party system limits representative democracy, breeds polarization, and suppresses fresh ideas necessary for progress.

First, let us address representation. Democracies are meant to be broad tents, places where every citizen’s voice matters. Yet under the two-party system, millions of citizens are forced to choose between options that do not accurately reflect their values and priorities. Think about it: our societies are not binary. Our beliefs and identities are not conveniently divisible into two neat camps of ""left"" and ""right,"" ""liberal"" and ""conservative."" Instead, the spectrum is vast. In practice, this binary system erases the multiplicity of identities and beliefs that should define our politics. Minorities, third-party advocates, and independent thinkers are silenced, their preferences lost in the national shuffle toward two predictable extremes. True representation requires not squeezing the public into two cramped boxes, but recognizing the full spectrum of its diversity.

Second, the two-party system exacerbates polarization and tribalism. It encourages us-versus-them mentalities—viewing the opposition as not simply rivals, but existential threats. Research has shown that in two-party systems, negative partisanship—voting against the other party rather than for one’s own—flourishes. This fosters political gridlock, hinders compromise, and turns citizens against one another. Real issues—climate change, healthcare, education—become weapons instead of topics for public discussion or collective problem-solving. Imagine, instead, a multiparty system: the necessity for coalition-building incentivizes cooperation over conflict, dialogue over division. With multiple parties, compromise stops being a dirty word and becomes essential to governing. Imagine a political environment where lawmakers are driven to argue the merits of their ideas and find common ground, rather than simply vilifying the opposition.

Third, the two-party system stifles innovation and progress. When there are only two major routes to power, both parties become risk-averse, catering to narrow bases, powerful donors, and entrenched interests. Fresh perspectives, urgent policy proposals, and truly transformative voices are sidelined. History is replete with examples: abolitionists, suffragettes, labor advocates, and civil rights leaders—all struggled for credibility in a duopoly that resisted change. Multiparty democracies allow new parties and voices to gain representation, pilot new ideas, and pressure incumbents to adapt or lose relevance. We need that vital infusion of creativity now more than ever as we face unprecedented challenges.

Some will argue that abolishing the two-party system will produce instability or confusion. Yet, around the world, multiparty democracies—from Germany to New Zealand to the Netherlands—deliver effective, stable governance with greater citizen satisfaction and higher voter turnout. These systems promote coalition-building and consensus, not chaos.

In conclusion, the two-party system is not an inescapable feature of democracy—it is a relic that hinders our collective progress. By abolishing it, we can foster genuine representation, reduce toxic polarization, and unleash the creative energy our political system so desperately lacks. Now is the time to build a democracy that reflects the true diversity and dynamism of its people. Let us be bold enough to believe in a future beyond binaries—a future where every voice can be heard, and every idea given fair consideration.

Thank you."
40a09427-4f51-4328-a95f-3015bc13e913,We should abolish the two-party system,gpt-4.1,"Honorable judges, esteemed opponents, and valued members of the audience,

Today, I stand before you to advocate for a fundamental transformation in our political landscape—one that will revive our democracy, restore public faith in governance, and embrace the rich diversity of thought our society truly contains. I am here to argue, unequivocally, that we should abolish the two-party system.

Let us begin by acknowledging what the two-party system is. It is a structure in which only two major political parties dominate the political scene, marginalizing every other voice. In places like the United States, this system has been entrenched for centuries. Its effects are so deep-rooted that they shape not just elections, but the very way we think about politics itself. But does this duopoly serve the people’s interest, or only its own? To answer that question, I present three key arguments: the two-party system stifles true representation, breeds polarization and gridlock, and erodes public trust in democracy.

First, the two-party system stifles true representation. Think of the vast array of identities, beliefs, and priorities that make up a modern society. Citizens are environmentalists, entrepreneurs, civil rights activists, farmers, teachers, immigrants—each with unique experiences and needs. Yet in a two-party system, this complex tapestry is forcibly woven into just two colors, two platforms. Voters are compelled to choose the “lesser evil,” not a true representative of their views. Voices outside the mainstream—be they progressives concerned with climate change, libertarians advocating for civil liberties, or centrists who desire pragmatic compromise—are sidelined, if not outright dismissed. A truly democratic society demands more than this false dichotomy. A multi-party system, as seen in numerous vibrant democracies, would offer voters meaningful choices and foster genuine representation.

Second, the two-party system breeds polarization and gridlock. By design, it divides the electorate into adversarial camps, where winning is prioritized over governing, and loyalty to party trumps constructive debate. Complex issues are reduced to simplistic binaries—right or wrong, us versus them. Instead of compromise, we see entrenched opposition. Consider legislative stalemates on critical matters such as healthcare, gun reform, or climate action. Bipartisan agreement—once the bedrock of progress—has given way to an era of hyper-partisanship, where each side is rewarded not for problem-solving, but for obstructing the other. This is not healthy for democracy. Multi-party systems, on the other hand, require coalitions, consensus-building, and a willingness to work together. The resulting legislation is often more inclusive, durable, and reflective of the electorate’s diversity.

Third, and perhaps most damningly, the two-party system erodes public trust in democracy itself. When only two options are offered—from school boards to the Senate—voters feel alienated, cynical, and unheard. Far too often, we hear the refrain: “My vote doesn’t matter.” Participation wanes, and apathy grows. Meanwhile, powerful interests exploit the predictability of the system, investing billions to entrench their influence within the two dominant parties. The result? Record low approval ratings for legislative bodies, and a general sense that the system is rigged against ordinary people.

Abolishing the two-party system would not be easy, but it is necessary. By embracing reforms such as ranked-choice voting, proportional representation, and open primaries, we can break the binary and open the floodgates to fresh ideas, diverse leadership, and genuine competition. We would give ourselves more than a choice between the “red pill” or the “blue pill.” We could build a political culture where all voices are heard, compromise is possible, and public faith in the system is renewed."
fed4ff40-1438-4ef2-8086-6e6e1f16e8dc,We should disband the United Nations,gpt-4.1,"Honorable judges, esteemed opponents, and respected audience,

Today, I stand before you to argue in favor of a bold proposition: We should disband the United Nations.

In 1945, the United Nations was founded with grand ideals—a hope for global peace, security, and cooperation after the devastation of World War II. Yet, as we sit here nearly eighty years later, we must ask ourselves a poignant question: Has the United Nations lived up to its promise? Has it truly fostered peace and unity, or has it become an obsolete organization marred by inefficacy, hypocrisy, and irrelevance in today’s rapidly changing world?

The first and most obvious failure of the United Nations lies in its inability to maintain world peace. Since its inception, over 200 armed conflicts have erupted around the globe, resulting in millions of deaths. From Rwanda to Syria, from Bosnia to Yemen, the UN stood by, hamstrung by bureaucracy and veto politics, while atrocities unfolded. Its so-called “peacekeepers” have at times become bystanders—at worst, perpetrators themselves. The massacre in Srebrenica, the genocide in Rwanda, the ongoing suffering in Palestine: these are not mere footnotes of failure. They are testaments to the systemic paralysis of an organization that promises protection but delivers platitudes.

Critically, the structure of the United Nations condemns it to perpetual ineffectiveness. The permanent membership and veto powers of the Security Council render genuine action impossible whenever the interests of any major power are at stake. Five countries, due to their victory in a war nearly a century ago, hold the fate of humanity in their hands. Is this democracy? Is this justice? No—it is geopolitical theater, where might makes right and the world’s many are held hostage by the whims of the privileged few. Matters of human lives, justice, and security should not be subject to the political convenience of superpowers.

Moreover, the UN has become a bloated bureaucracy, siphoning vast resources while offering very little in return. Billions of dollars are spent annually on staff salaries, diplomatic gatherings, and endless reports. Yet the world’s crises persist, from hunger to climate disaster, from proliferation to pandemic. The money spent sustaining the UN could be far better invested directly in local and regional aid, medical relief, educational initiatives, and conflict-resolution efforts with actual accountability and measurable results.

Some might argue that without the UN, there would be chaos, that it serves as a vital platform for diplomacy and international dialogue. But I ask you to consider: Are global problems being solved at Turtle Bay, or perpetuated by endless negotiation with little resolve? International cooperation is not dependent on a monolithic, outdated institution. Diverse global challenges require agile, regional, and specialized solutions—not a one-size-fits-all bureaucracy.

Furthermore, the UN has become a stage for some of the world’s worst human rights offenders to lecture others, shielding their abuses behind diplomatic immunity. Rogue states win seats on the Human Rights Council while silencing dissent at home. Genuine human rights advocates are forced to sit at the same table as their oppressors. This gives legitimacy to the illegitimate and undermines the very principles the organization was meant to uphold.

Ladies and gentlemen, progress requires courage—the courage to face the truth, the courage to let go of failed experiments, and the courage to innovate. It is time to recognize that the United Nations has outlived its usefulness."
85ec416b-aec9-48be-9d90-7c72a184b49e,We should disband the United Nations,gpt-4.1,"Honorable judges, esteemed opponents, and respected audience,

Today, I stand firmly resolved that we should disband the United Nations.

Let me be crystal clear: the proposition is neither naive nor radical; rather, it is a sober recognition that the United Nations—founded in 1945 with noble intentions—has, in our complex and interconnected present, become obsolete, ineffective, and even counterproductive. As history and current events reveal, the UN fails to deliver on its most essential promises. It is time to reimagine global cooperation by discarding a body whose structure is fundamentally flawed, whose actions are chronically paralyzed, and which often does more harm than good in the pursuit of world peace, justice, and human progress.

Let me begin with the most glaring issue: institutional paralysis. The very mechanism designed to prevent global conflict—the Security Council—is institutionally hamstrung by the power of veto. Five permanent members—China, France, Russia, the United States, and the United Kingdom—can unilaterally block any substantive resolution, regardless of majority consensus or moral urgency. This antiquated power structure reflects the geopolitics of 1945, not the needs or realities of today’s global community of nearly 200 nations. The result? Catastrophic inaction. The UN has failed to prevent or resolve genocides from Rwanda to Syria, conflicts in Ukraine and Myanmar, and it repeatedly caves to the self-interests of powerful actors while letting weaker states bear the burden of crisis.

Next, let us consider the hypocrisy that permeates the organization. The UN espouses ideals of democracy, human rights, and rule of law. Yet, its major organs routinely elevate and legitimize the worst abusers of these very principles. Autocratic states, many of whom are chronic human rights violators, not only participate in, but often chair, essential bodies such as the Human Rights Council. This isn’t just an embarrassment—it undermines victims, emboldens perpetrators, and makes a mockery of the global fight for justice.

Third, we must acknowledge the UN’s ineffectiveness in crisis response. The world watched in horror as genocides unfolded in Cambodia, Rwanda, and Darfur—while the United Nations, with vast resources and diplomatic legitimacy, failed abjectly to intervene. Even in our present, as millions suffer under war, famine, and persecution in Yemen, Syria, and the Rohingya crisis, the UN’s role has been largely limited to toothless resolutions, symbolic gestures, and endless diplomatic theater. Too often, ""UN intervention"" has become synonymous with bureaucratic inertia rather than decisive action.

Furthermore, the United Nations is frequently co-opted as a tool of geopolitics rather than people-centered progress. Major powers wield it to legitimize their foreign policy aims, while rival blocs use the institution as a battleground for proxy conflicts. This politicization renders the UN incapable of serving as an impartial arbiter or a genuine protector of the weak.

Now, some may argue that, imperfect as it is, the United Nations is the best hope we have for global dialogue and peace. But hope and symbolism do not save lives or enforce international law. We must not, out of nostalgia or fear, tie ourselves to an obsolete structure that not only fails to solve global problems but too often exacerbates them. Resources, time, and political capital expended on maintaining the UN could be better invested in new, more innovative, and more responsive forms of international cooperation—alliances built upon genuine accountability, effectiveness, and shared values.

In conclusion, the United Nations is not only unfit for purpose—it is an active impediment to progress. By disbanding the UN, we make way for a new era of global partnership—one predicated on principle, equality, and real capacity for action."
4010fad6-4d77-400c-860f-e611884faa9d,We should subsidize distance education,gpt-4.1,"Honorable judges, esteemed opponents, and valued audience, today, I stand firmly in support of the motion: “We should subsidize distance education.”

Allow me to begin with a simple question: In an era defined by technological advancement and interconnectedness, should access to education remain tethered to geography and wealth? Or should we—as responsible global citizens—ensure that every learner, regardless of background, has the opportunity to unlock their full potential? The answer is clear. Subsidizing distance education is not merely an option; it is an imperative in our pursuit of equity, progress, and prosperity.

Let us first acknowledge the transformative reach of distance education. Traditionally, quality education has been the privilege of the few—those living near urban hubs, capable of affording tuition, accommodation, transportation, and learning materials. Yet, millions—whether in rural communities, underserved urban areas, or remote corners of the world—remain excluded from this vital path to opportunity. Distance education breaks down these barriers with one powerful tool: connectivity. But this promise cannot fulfill itself. Many learners lack the financial means or access to the necessary technology, reliable internet, or digital resources. Only government intervention, in the form of targeted subsidies, can bridge this digital divide.

Subsidizing distance education is an investment in educational equity. When we support learners in accessing accredited online programs, we extend opportunity to marginalized communities, persons with disabilities, working parents, and those disadvantaged by traditional models. For a rural student unable to commute long distances, an adult retraining for a new career without leaving their job, or a young mother balancing childcare and learning, subsidized distance education offers a lifeline. It is a concrete step toward fulfilling the universal right to education—no matter who you are or where you live.

Beyond matters of access, let us consider the efficiency and scalability of distance education. Unlike brick-and-mortar institutions burdened by infrastructure costs and limited capacity, online learning platforms reach thousands, even millions, at a fraction of the expense. By offering subsidies, governments can facilitate the rapid upskilling and reskilling of national workforces—critical for thriving in today’s rapidly changing economy. Take the example of countries that faced massive educational disruption during the COVID-19 pandemic. Those with robust, subsidized distance education systems weathered the storm more effectively, minimizing learning loss. The model has proven not only resilient but also adaptable to the demands of a volatile global landscape.

Some may object, citing concerns about the quality of online education or the possibility of wasted public funds. But let us not use the shortcomings of early models as an excuse for inaction; instead, we should harness subsidies to drive up quality. By directing funding toward the development of rigorous online curricula, training for digital instructors, and access to cutting-edge educational technologies, we can set and enforce high standards—ensuring that distance education is not a second-class alternative, but a path to excellence.

Furthermore, subsidy programs need not simply hand out funds indiscriminately. They can—and should—be designed with accountability and impact in mind. We can prioritize learners with the greatest need, tie subsidies to performance metrics, and regularly evaluate outcomes. This is not just doable—it is our duty.

Finally, let us reflect on the broader societal benefits. By subsidizing distance education, we foster a more educated, adaptable, and innovative workforce. We reduce educational inequality—leading to greater social cohesion, civic participation, and economic growth. Every dollar spent yields dividends for the individual and society alike.

In closing, subsidizing distance education is not merely a policy preference; it is a moral, social, and economic necessity."
92d37c26-766f-41aa-a4e2-6c0533113bed,We should subsidize distance education,gpt-4.1,"Ladies and gentlemen, honorable judges, esteemed opponents, and valued audience members,

Today, I stand before you to advocate for a crucial and timely proposition: that we should subsidize distance education. In a rapidly changing world marked by technological innovation, shifting economic landscapes, and evolving social needs, the question is not if we should support the expansion of distance education, but how swiftly and effectively we can ensure that it is accessible to all. Subsidizing distance education is essential for advancing equity, economic opportunity, societal resilience, and national competitiveness.

Let us begin by addressing the fundamental issue of access. Around the globe, millions of individuals—whether due to geography, disability, socioeconomic status, or life circumstances—face significant barriers to accessing traditional, in-person education. Rural students may live hours from the nearest educational institution. Working adults may be unable to attend on-campus classes due to inflexible schedules. Students with disabilities may encounter physical obstacles or support shortfalls. By subsidizing distance education, we empower these individuals to overcome barriers and participate in learning that is as high-quality, rigorous, and interactive as traditional options. Subsidies ensure that financial limitations will not prevent motivated learners from accessing education that can change their lives.

Secondly, subsidizing distance education fuels social mobility and economic opportunity. At a time when the labor market is rapidly evolving, lifelong learning has become indispensable. The days of acquiring skills in young adulthood and applying them unchanged throughout a career are over. Workers of all ages must now reskill and upskill to keep pace with technological progress and changing industries. Subsidized distance education provides the means for individuals facing unemployment, career transitions, or skills gaps to retrain efficiently and affordably. In turn, this strengthens the entire economy, making our workforce more adaptive, innovative, and competitive.

Moreover, subsidizing distance education amplifies educational equity. Let us be candid: even in the most developed regions, significant disparities persist in educational attainment. Wealthier families can afford supplementary tutoring, travel to top institutions, and the latest learning technology. Without state intervention, these disparities grow, leaving behind those who are already disadvantaged. Subsidies level the playing field. They enable low-income students to access the same high-standard courses, digital resources, and expert instruction as their wealthier peers. This is not charity—it is a strategic investment in social cohesion and the collective future.

Fourthly, embracing and subsidizing distance education fosters resilience in the face of disruption. The COVID-19 pandemic exposed the vulnerabilities of education systems built almost exclusively on in-person attendance. Entire cohorts suffered academic setbacks, and systemic inequalities deepened as online learning became a privilege rather than a right. This demonstrated, in no uncertain terms, that access to robust distance education is no longer a luxury; it is a necessity for national resilience in the face of crises, whether they be pandemics, natural disasters, or economic upheavals. Subsidizing such education ensures continuity of learning and guarantees that the education sector can adapt swiftly, without leaving the marginalized even further behind.

Lastly, subsidizing distance education strengthens national competitiveness and fosters innovation. The global race for talent is intensifying. Nations that invest in accessible, high-quality education for all—regardless of circumstance—will cultivate the diverse, skilled populations needed to meet complex 21st-century challenges. By subsidizing distance education, we nurture not only a workforce skilled for the demands of tomorrow, but also one that is more diverse, creative, and adaptable.

In closing, to subsidize distance education is to invest in people—our greatest resource. It meets the moral imperative for equality, the economic imperative for growth, and the societal imperative for resilience."
51a42fd1-3eed-43db-85f4-dbd1506d5b2b,We should introduce year round schooling,gpt-4.1,"Ladies and gentlemen, esteemed judges, worthy opponents, and valued audience, today I stand before you to advocate for a transformative change in our educational system—a change that is not only timely but essential. The resolution before us is clear and consequential: we should introduce year-round schooling.

We are all products of an education system largely defined over a century ago—an era when summer vacations aligned with the rhythms of agrarian life, not the demands of a modern economy or the needs of contemporary students. Today, the reality is different. Less than two percent of Americans now live on farms, and yet our academic calendar remains tethered to an outdated agricultural timetable. It is time for an upgrade.

First, let us address the most glaring flaw of our current system: the “summer slide.” Research by the National Summer Learning Association consistently shows that students lose significant ground each summer—the equivalent of up to three months of reading and math skills. This learning loss is cumulative, disproportionately affects disadvantaged students, and widens the achievement gap year after year. Year-round schooling combats this problem head-on. By redistributing the long summer break into shorter, frequent intersessions throughout the year, we minimize the interruption in learning, ensuring that hard-won academic gains are retained.

Moreover, year-round schooling enhances educational equity. For students from low-income families, summers are not filled with expensive camps or globe-trotting vacations but with limited access to enriching activities. This lack of resources causes these students to fall even further behind their more affluent peers. A balanced, year-round calendar provides continuous access to structured learning, supportive adults, and essential services like meals and counseling—a lifeline for students who need it the most.

Let us also consider the benefits to teachers—our most valuable educational resource. Year-round schooling reduces burnout by offering more frequent, shorter breaks. Teachers return to the classroom refreshed, with fewer months of material to review and reteach. This translates to more efficient use of instructional time and improved job satisfaction, which in turn promotes teacher retention and consistency for our students.

But the advantages extend beyond academic gains. Year-round schooling supports working families. In a society where most parents work twelve months a year, the long summer break is a logistical nightmare, riddled with soaring childcare costs and a lack of affordable supervision. By better aligning the school calendar with the realities of modern life, we ease the burden on families, promote economic productivity, and foster greater work-life balance.

Furthermore, let us note the logistical efficiencies. Year-round schooling often utilizes a “multi-track” system, dividing students into rotating groups. This means that while some students are on break, others are in school, allowing districts to accommodate more students within existing facilities—maximizing resources, reducing overcrowding, and delaying the need for expensive new buildings.

Critics may argue that year-round schooling denies children a carefree summer or disrupts family traditions. But let us clarify: year-round schooling does not eliminate breaks; it redistributes them, ensuring students and families still enjoy ample time off, but staggered throughout the year. Not only does this reduce the stress of long academic stretches, but it also offers families greater flexibility in planning vacations at less crowded, less expensive times.

In conclusion, year-round schooling is not a radical experiment but a proven reform already implemented successfully in thousands of schools across the nation. The evidence is clear: it reduces learning loss, narrows achievement gaps, supports families, optimizes public resources, and fosters a healthier, more sustainable rhythm for students and teachers alike."
12d66775-5ada-4f7b-8901-68ba094e26ca,We should introduce year round schooling,gpt-4.1,"Ladies and gentlemen, esteemed judges, and respected opponents,

Today, I stand firmly in support of the motion: We should introduce year-round schooling.

Education is the bedrock of our society. As the world changes rapidly, we must continually ask: Does our system of schooling truly serve the needs of our students, families, and our future? The traditional model of schooling—a long summer break followed by blocks of instruction—is not only outdated, but it is also far less effective compared to a year-round approach. I urge you to consider the compelling reasons in favor of this transformative proposal.

First and foremost, year-round schooling addresses the pressing issue of the ""summer slide,"" or learning loss. Studies show that during the traditional three-month summer vacation, students forget significant portions of the material they learned, particularly in critical subjects like math and reading. According to research from the RAND Corporation and the National Summer Learning Association, students can lose up to two months of grade-level equivalency in math over the summer. Year-round schooling, with shorter breaks more evenly distributed throughout the year, keeps students engaged and helps retain their knowledge, resulting in improved educational outcomes and stronger academic performance over time.

Second, year-round schooling better meets the needs of today's families. The modern workforce no longer follows an agrarian calendar. Most parents do not have the luxury of three months off in the summer, which leads to increased stress as families scramble for childcare solutions. Shorter, more frequent breaks allow families to plan vacations at off-peak times, reducing costs and easing the burden on working parents. Moreover, regular routines minimize the disruption to family life and create stability for children, which is especially vital in our fast-paced, sometimes chaotic, society.

Third, year-round schooling promotes educational equity. The traditional model disproportionately harms students from lower-income backgrounds, who may lack access to enriching summer activities. As a result, educational gaps between affluent and disadvantaged students tend to widen over the long break. With year-round schooling, all children gain consistent access to learning and school resources, helping to close the achievement gap and ensuring that success is not dictated by socioeconomic status.

Fourth, implementing year-round schooling allows for better use of our educational infrastructure. Schools sit empty for months during the summer, while their maintenance, utilities, and facilities continue to incur costs. A year-round model optimizes these investments by keeping buildings and resources in use, maximizing taxpayer dollars and providing greater value to our communities. Furthermore, staggered schedules or multi-track systems can alleviate overcrowding by distributing student attendance throughout the year.

Fifth, continuous instruction benefits teachers and school communities as well. Frequent breaks throughout the year help reduce teacher burnout and stress. Teachers and staff have more opportunities to assess student progress and provide timely interventions, rather than playing ""catch-up"" after a long summer layoff. This approach supports professional development, stronger relationships, and a healthier work environment.

Some might argue that summer is a time for fun, for family, for exploration beyond the classroom. However, year-round schooling does not eliminate breaks; it simply redistributes them. Students still enjoy substantial time off, but in a way that promotes retention, consistency, and opportunity for all.

In conclusion, the evidence is clear: year-round schooling combats learning loss, supports families, closes achievement gaps, makes better use of resources, and creates a healthier environment for both students and educators. It is a forward-thinking model that recognizes the realities of our 21st-century world.

Let us not cling to tradition for tradition’s sake. Instead, let us embrace the model that best prepares our children for their futures."
aeb3b243-521b-480d-9ace-ad929d77ea97,We should adopt socialism,gpt-4.1,"Ladies and gentlemen, honorable judges, esteemed opponents, and valued audience members:

Today, we stand at a crossroads—a moment in history defined by sweeping inequality, environmental crisis, and social unrest. The world in which we live is one where the richest one percent owns more wealth than the bottom fifty percent combined. Millions lack access to basic healthcare, education is a pipeline for privilege rather than potential, and countless are driven to poverty not by choice, but by a system that prioritizes profit over people. In light of these challenges, we affirm the resolution: We should adopt socialism.

First, let us clarify what socialism truly means. Socialism is not the vilification of wealth nor the abolition of markets. Rather, it is a political and economic system in which the means of production, distribution, and exchange are owned or regulated by the community as a whole, with the primary objective of ensuring that wealth and resources are shared equitably among all members of society. At its core, socialism is about expanding democracy into our economic lives, not just our political ones. It is about recognizing that human dignity should never be left at the mercy of the market.

Why should we, then, adopt socialism? The case is both moral and practical.

Firstly, socialism provides a remedy to the structural inequality endemic to capitalism. In our current system, wealth accrues to those who own capital, while the vast majority who sell their labor compete for scraps. The result is the perpetuation of generational poverty, widening class divides, and a democracy undermined by the corrupting influence of concentrated economic power. Under socialism, essential industries—like healthcare, education, energy, and transportation—are treated as public goods, not commodities. This reorientation ensures that everyone, regardless of birth or background, has access to the fruits of our collective labor.

Secondly, socialism upholds the right to a dignified life. Across Europe, nations with robust social democratic institutions—rooted in socialist ideals—enjoy the highest standards of living, longest life expectancies, and greatest levels of happiness. Universal healthcare in the UK, tuition-free education in Germany, public housing in Norway—the successes are many, profound, and well-documented. These are not abstract ideals, but proven policies that have lifted millions from poverty and granted opportunity to those who have historically been left behind.

Thirdly, socialism presents practical solutions to existential crises, chief among them being the environmental emergency. Capitalism, in its relentless pursuit of growth and profit, has driven us to the precipice of ecological collapse. Socialism, by contrast, offers a framework for collective stewardship of natural resources—where production is guided by societal need and ecological sustainability, not short-term profits. Socialized energy grids, public investment in renewable technologies, and democratic control over resource extraction are essential steps if we are to leave a livable planet for future generations.

Some opponents claim that socialism stifles innovation or undermines individual liberty. However, history tells us another story. From the moon landing to the Internet, it was public investment—coordinated action for the common good—that catalyzed breakthroughs. Socialism does not suffocate ambition; it removes the barriers of poverty, ill-health, and deprivation that currently wage war on human potential.

In summation, the adoption of socialism is not a utopian dream. It is a rational, just, and necessary response to the failures of our current system. It is a call to recognize that our collective well-being is inseparable from the well-being of each individual. The challenges of our era demand courage, compassion, and a commitment to change."
35ea0d2c-65e4-4006-b038-de53e36c00d3,We should adopt socialism,gpt-4.1,"Honorable judges, esteemed opponents, and distinguished audience,

Today, I stand before you to advocate for a bold and necessary vision: we should adopt socialism. Now, more than ever, as we face escalating inequality, environmental crises, and the persistent failures of the current economic paradigm, adopting socialism emerges not merely as an ideological preference, but as a pragmatic and urgent solution.

Let me begin by clarifying what we mean by socialism. Socialism, at its core, is an economic and political system in which the means of production—factories, natural resources, essential services, and infrastructure—are collectively owned and democratically managed by the people. Unlike the dog-eat-dog competition of unchecked capitalism, socialism prioritizes human needs over profit, and cooperation over exploitation. It does not mean eliminating markets, freedom, or personal ambition; rather, it ensures that these ambitions do not trample the well-being and dignity of the many for the enrichment of the few.

Our current system is dominated by capitalism—a system that has, no doubt, spurred innovation, but at a staggering cost. Globally, the richest 1% own nearly half of the world’s wealth. In the United States—ostensibly the richest country on Earth—over half a million people are homeless on any given night, while others hoard billions. Essential services like healthcare, education, and housing have been commodified, depriving millions of their basic rights. The market has become a lottery, not a ladder, where the accident of birth far outweighs the value of hard work. Is it any wonder that rates of poverty, mental illness, and despair continue to rise despite unprecedented wealth?

Now, consider what socialism offers. Under a socialist system, healthcare is not a privilege bought on the marketplace, but a guaranteed human right, free at the point of use. Countries with socialized medicine—such as Norway, Sweden, and the UK—consistently outperform their privatized peers in health outcomes and patient satisfaction, at lower costs. The same holds true in education, where socialist principles enable free or affordable access to world-class schooling, leveling the playing field for all children, not just those born into privilege.

Socialism doesn’t stifle innovation; it redirects it. Instead of chasing quarterly profits, we empower communities and workers to co-own companies, invest in green technologies, and prioritize long-term social good. In the climate crisis—arguably humanity’s greatest threat—socialism offers a mechanism to plan collectively, mobilize resources, and act rapidly, unencumbered by the narrow interests of shareholders.

But socialism is not mere theory; it is practice backed by evidence. Social democracies that have embraced socialist policies—like Finland and Denmark—enjoy higher standards of living, longer life expectancy, happier populations, and more resilient economies. Critics warn of inefficiency, but the data show otherwise: these societies are consistently ranked among the best places to live, work, and raise a family.

Adopting socialism also means deepening democracy. In socialism, workers are not mere cogs in a machine—they are participants in decision-making, from the shop floor to the boardroom. This economic democracy is the logical extension of our political freedoms; it means having a real say not just in the voting booth, but in the places where we spend our lives.

In closing, the adoption of socialism is not a utopian fantasy; it is a rational, humane, and historically proven response to the failures of a system that has prioritized profit over people for too long. By adopting socialism, we can build a society that is fair, sustainable, and free—where everyone, not just the fortunate few, has the right and the means to flourish.

Thank you."
e5ef9dec-ad36-4fc7-9b36-31ebf33f9666,We should introduce recall elections,gpt-4.1,"Honourable chair, esteemed judges, respected opponents, and distinguished audience,

Today, we stand at the threshold of a crucial debate that strikes at the very core of democracy itself. The motion before us is clear: “We should introduce recall elections.” On behalf of the proposition, I stand here to present not merely an endorsement of this motion, but a compelling vision for a stronger, more accountable, and ultimately, a more democratic society.

Let us begin by examining the fundamental principle underpinning modern democracy: the authority of the people. Elected officials are entrusted with profound responsibilities. They legislate, govern, and make decisions that touch every aspect of our lives. Yet, in nearly all democracies, once these individuals are elected, they remain insulated from direct public accountability until the next scheduled election — often four, five, or even six years later. This gap leaves citizens virtually powerless in the face of broken promises, ethical breaches, or outright incompetence.

Recall elections are the crucial corrective mechanism our democracies desperately need. A recall election allows voters, upon gathering adequate support, to remove an elected official from office before the end of their term. This simple, yet transformative mechanism ensures that politicians remain accountable not just in words, but in action — every day, not simply at election time.

Consider, for a moment, the scenario we observe all too often: An official is elected on a platform of reform but succumbs to corruption, neglect, or indifference once in office. What recourse do the people have? Letters can be written, protests organized, but little concrete can be done until the next election cycle, by which time the damage to policies, institutions, or indeed public trust, may be irreparable. Recall elections empower the electorate, transforming democracy from a passive, periodic event into a living, responsive process. In doing so, they give true weight to the concept of public service — elected officials know that continued legitimacy depends on ongoing, earned trust, not merely on the outcome of a single contest.

Let us not mistake recall elections as a tool of chaos or populist vengeance. When properly designed, with sensible thresholds and robust procedures, recall elections are a safeguard, not a weapon. They deter misconduct, rather than encourage instability. In jurisdictions where recall is already in place—such as local governments in the United States, Switzerland, and Japan—evidence shows that recalls are rare and reserved for serious cases of malfeasance or loss of confidence. Voters use this mechanism judiciously, treating it as a last, not first, resort.

Moreover, recall elections can foster a more engaged citizenry. When citizens know they have tangible influence over representatives throughout their terms, civic attentiveness increases. The knowledge that accountability is direct and immediate inspires both greater public participation and higher standards of conduct among officeholders.

There are those who may warn of the risks: instability, the politicization of governance, or mob rule. But these fears presuppose that citizens cannot be trusted with the full powers of democracy. We disagree. Recall is not a rejection of our current system; it is a vital enhancement to it—one that trusts and empowers citizens, while keeping true to the ethos that government exists to serve the governed.

In conclusion, recall elections are more than just a procedural innovation; they are a vital affirmation of democratic values. They honour the principle that political power is a continuing trust, not a blank check."
8642bb42-6666-44f1-bf96-d9436a520028,We should introduce recall elections,gpt-4.1,"Honorable judges, esteemed opponents, and valued audience,

Today, I stand before you to affirm the motion: ""We should introduce recall elections."" The arguments I present are not only grounded in democratic theory but also in compelling real-world examples, common sense, and the need for more responsive and accountable governance.

At its heart, democracy is about the people—their voice, their will, and their capacity to govern themselves. Elections allow citizens to choose their representatives, but what happens when those chosen betray the trust placed in them? What recourse do the people have if an elected official becomes corrupt, grossly negligent, or refuses to serve the public interest? For too long, the absence of mid-term accountability has eroded faith in political systems worldwide. Recall elections offer a practical, powerful solution.

Let me begin with the principle of accountability. Elected officials wield power that directly impacts the lives of millions. Yet, under our current systems, voters often have to wait years—sometimes up to five—for the chance to express their dissatisfaction. Imagine a public servant whose actions are harmful, whose incompetence is clear, or whose promises have turned to dust. Waiting for the next scheduled election can be agonizing for the constituency and deeply damaging to the community. Recall elections put power back where it belongs: in the hands of the people. If a significant portion of an electorate no longer trusts their representative, they should not be forced to endure misgovernance. With recall elections, politicians are reminded every day: they serve at the pleasure of those who elected them.

Secondly, recall elections deter corruption and malfeasance. When officials know they are under constant, watchful scrutiny, with the real possibility of being removed before their term ends, they are less likely to act against the public interest. Evidence from countries like the United States—where several states and localities allow recalls—shows that even the threat of recall prompts elected officials to act with greater transparency and integrity. This tool creates a culture of accountability, sending a strong message: no one is above the law or beyond removal, even between election cycles.

Third, recall elections have a reinvigorating effect on civic participation. Democracies succeed when citizens are engaged not just at the ballot box but throughout an elected official’s term. Recalls force constituents to stay informed, to watch closely, and to act collectively if their trust is violated. In an era plagued by cynicism and apathy, recall elections are a remedy—a tangible demonstration to citizens that their voices matter, always.

Some may argue that recall elections could destabilize governments or be misused for partisan purposes. While this concern is important, robust legal frameworks and clear thresholds—such as requiring a substantial percentage of voter signatures to trigger a recall—can safeguard against frivolous or malicious use. In the many jurisdictions that allow recalls, abuses are rare because the process is rigorous and demands real public dissatisfaction. Precious few recalls are ever initiated, and even fewer succeed—this is not a tool for everyday dissatisfaction but for meaningful, collective action when truly necessary.

Finally, recall elections align with the highest ideals of representative democracy. They embody the notion that public officials are not masters, but temporary stewards of public trust. When that trust is broken, citizens deserve more than passive disapproval—they deserve meaningful recourse.

In closing, recall elections are not about undermining stability. They are about affirming trust, empowering citizens, deterring corruption, and ensuring our governments remain true to the values we cherish. Let us not accept accountability on a timer; let us demand leaders who are always responsive to those they serve.

Thank you."
